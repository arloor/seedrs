## Idea

### Introduction

As the CTO of an e-commerce agency for 10+ years, our founder witnessed the problems with innovating and scaling bespoke e-commerce websites, before retailers moved to powerful platforms like Magento and Demandware.

In today's mobile first world, we believe that many retailers are having similar growing pains with bespoke native apps. Poq was created to provide a commerce platform for native apps – allowing retailers to innovate on mobile in a scalable way.

Poq is a commerce platform for native retail apps. The SaaS platform enables over retailers, including House of Fraser, Missguided, Steven Alan, Radley and Blue Inc, to deliver best-in-class mobile apps across Android and iOS – updated quarterly and integrated with any major e-commerce platform. We offer large retailers a reliable and scalable way to deploy and maintain native apps.

Our team of experienced professionals is mostly focussed on technology development and have a wide e-commerce background.

### Key Terms

As with the previous round, the lead investors in this round will receive shares which have a participating preference on a return of proceeds, as follows:

- Preferential return. <br>On a distribution of proceeds on exit or winding up, the lead investors will receive the amount of their original subscription back, in preference to other shareholders. All shareholders (including the lead investors) would then share the remainder of proceeds available for distribution on a pro rata basis.

- Capped. <br>The preference above will only apply if the proceeds available on exit/winding are such that if they were to be distributed pro rata among all shareholders, each Series A shareholder would receive less than 3 times the issue price for each share held. If the valuation is higher, the lead investors will participate alongside all other holders of ordinary shares on equal terms.

Seedrs investors will be offered ordinary shares, which will be eligible for EIS relief (preference shares are not generally eligible for EIS relief).
