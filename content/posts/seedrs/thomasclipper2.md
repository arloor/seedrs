## Idea

### Introduction

We look after well-travelled men who value high-quality British design and world-class craftsmanship.

To date our product range includes:

• 3 models of classic razor <br>• Organic shave oil &amp; cotton flannel <br>• 300 year-old British timber shave bowl and brush <br>• 5,000 year-old semi-fossilised oak bowl and brush <br>• Handmade razor stand <br>• Natural shave soap <br>• Italian leather wash bags <br>• Small batch blending cologne collection <br>• New product ranges to launch Summer 2018

We combine high-quality craftsmanship with a modern design and a new attitude to business: open, transparent and responsible.

We have a community-driven approach: we have funded our product development with three successful 5-figure Kickstarter campaigns, one crowdfunded equity campaign, and created our own bespoke product crowdfunding platform, First Edition.
