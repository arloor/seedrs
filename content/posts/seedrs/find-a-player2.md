## Idea

### Introduction

Find a Player is a smartphone app that makes it easier for people to find, organise and play sports.

Our app covers over 140 different sports and has 2 core functions.

1. Acts as a hub between players and games on a local basis. <br>2. Automates and simplifies game organisation process.

We allow our users to set up activities using the app and invite their friends straight from their phone contacts. Thereafter we help them to connect with other local users with similar sports interests.

Conversely, people who have just moved to a new area or simply want to get involved in more sport can search, find and join local activities that need more participants.

Our app automates the entire invitation and organisation process, providing full in-app communication, chat and allowing gaps in games to be filled quickly and easily by local, available players.

Essentially we're a sports participation network, making it easier for people to find, organise and play sport in their local area.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only to existing investors, limited information is being provided at this time.
