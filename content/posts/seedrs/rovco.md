### Introduction

This is a pre-emption campaign for Rovco (a Sustainable Accelerator fund company) who are raising a maximum of £1,000,000.44 of funds. As an existing shareholder in Rovco you have the right to exercise your pre-emption rights in order to maintain your current percentage ownership in the business.

This pre-emption campaign will remain open for 10 days after which time you will no longer be able to exercise your pre-emption rights.

Please note that although your pre-emption rights are based on the maximum round size (£1,000,000.44), the Company may accept less than this figure.
