### Convertible Details

This investment round is being raised by way of a convertible equity investment structure, in this case an "advanced subscription agreement".

The key terms that apply to the Recruitment Smart advanced subscription agreement are set out below. See also attached Key Terms document for further details.

• Discount – conversion at a 20% discount to the valuation set by a Trigger Event.

• Valuation cap of £16,000,000.

• Conversion is triggered by ("Trigger Events"):

o An Equity Fundraise – defined as the Company raising investment capital of at least £1,500,000 from one transaction or a series of transactions, in exchange for the company issuing of Ordinary Shares; <br>o A Change of Control of the company (transfer of more than 50% of the share capital); or <br>o An IPO – being a listing of the company’s shares on a recognised stock market or secondary market.

• Longstop Date is 12 months from the date of the convertible agreement.

• If conversion has not been triggered by the longstop date shares will be issued on the longstop date at a valuation based on the lower of:

(i) the lowest price of any Ordinary Share issued after the date of this Agreement; and <br>(ii) a pre-money company valuation of £10,000,000 on a fully diluted basis. <br>The convertible would also convert to equity at this price in the event of winding up or liquidation of the company.

### Intended impact.

The current recruitment process in most large organisations is highly labour intensive and has become increasingly complex due to new and emerging online job boards, compliance and reduction of bias.

● AI-enabled systems can scan applications far more quickly than humans and work out whether candidates are a good fit. <br>● AI-enabled systems can leverage candidates from historic applications, once interested to work with the organisation. <br>● HR departments are under increasing pressure to be inclusive to all sexes, ages, backgrounds, religions, creeds, beliefs etc. AI-enabled systems can provide an unbiased solution promoting diversity in the workplace.

SniperAI aims to provide an AI-powered solution to all the existing problems around sourcing and screening so that recruiters can spend time in candidate engagement and thereby increase the candidate experience by many folds.

### Monetisation strategy.

The global recruitment market is worth £350 billion and growing at an increasing rate. Many organisations are constantly buying and upgrading their IT systems and ATS’s in the hope that they can source candidates quicker and cheaper. <br>Our product pricing model is aimed to make the recruiters decision an easy one. There are no charges for placements (as with agencies), no charges for data volumes (some IT suppliers use this model) and no unknown costs.

The pricing model is simple and straightforward:. <br>● Initial integration cost to capture job descriptions and data sources. <br>● Monthly user licenses, irrelevant of placement numbers, data usage, geography. <br>● Enterprise license (use as much as you like) available to larger users.

We also work with partners, some of them are suppliers of ATS’s - SAP and Oracle, and in discussions with other including technology service providers like Accenture, Capgemini, E&amp;Y, PwC, Deloitte who introduce innovation and industry best practices to their clients.

### Use of proceeds

We are executing this funding round to continue scaling up business operations while also investing in new product development. Use of proceeds is detailed below:.

MARKETING AND SALES:. <br>• Grow customer reach and brand awareness through increased marketing expenditure. <br>• Attend events such as Slush in December. <br>• Launch additional pilots with our existing leads. <br>• Recruit a full-time Marketing Manager.
