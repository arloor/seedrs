## Idea

### Introduction

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/16371/bzlf1nfokhx3kw80ffa7iwks1ijl6gb/h.jpg?rect=0%2C-1%2C4000%2C2667&w=600&fit=clip&s=45709d13a35b7928ca8352e06e125ce6)

After three successful years in Hackney, Dandy is set to launch its first permanent restaurant and bar in a high-footfall location on Maltby Street, Bermondsey in 2019. The venture will be backed by established restaurateur and investor Matt Wells, co-founder of The Dairy, Counter Culture, Knife Steak House and more.

With an expansive 10-metre open kitchen and bar, Dandy will place a dedicated spotlight on beer, working closely with twelve local and independent brewers from Bermondsey’s ‘beer mile’ and beyond. The wine list will be all-natural, while a dining menu cooked by critically-acclaimed Chef Dan Wilson will be available daily.

Additionally, 2019 will see the opening of an in-house brewery on the second level of the venue, with scope to develop a B2B wholesale and take-away retail offering making this an attractive prospect for investors.

### Intended impact

At Dandy we want to serve the best of what we can find, from beer and wine to turnips and taleggio. We want to keep Dandy’s name front and centre as a restaurant changing the nature of dining in London. <br> <br>We have identified Bermondsey as the perfect home to offer our food and drink; using the best ingredients possible in a way that is both interesting and comforting. <br> <br>The former Monmouth Coffee arch is a unique space and will not only provide the perfect restaurant setting to serve our food and drink, but also allow us the space to build our new brewery and offer a product which appeals to both our customers and other vendors.

The money raised will cement us at the top of Maltby Street Market and in Bermondsey, the beer capital of London, allowing us to work with consistency and creativity towards expansion into additional areas of London.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

We opened Dandy 1.0, a 25-seat neighbourhood restaurant, in a driveway in London Fields in November 2015. Within three months we achieved critical success. We built a thriving community and loyal following and were recognised by Observer Food Monthly in February who named us in their top 50 things in food for 2016 (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="outside" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/20/ofm-50-what-we-love-about-food-2016">https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/m...</a>).

In March 2017 Dandy expanded its offering to a larger semi-permanent site in Newington Green. We served x60 covers in the restaurant with an in-house bakery also. After only a month we were named as one of the five restaurants driving change in the London food scene by food writer Corby Kummer.

Dandy’s tenure in Newington Green ended in November 2017. Since then we have searched for the perfect site and after nearly a year trying to secure a new restaurant location, founder Dan Wilson teamed up with Matt Wells to open Dandy 3.0 in Bermondsey.

Matt Wells co-founded critically acclaimed restaurant The Dairy, Counter Culture, and Paradise Garage with Robin and Sarah Gill and personally curated and invested in the following successful London venues:

Yama Momo, East Dulwich. <br>Knife Steakhouse, Clapham. <br>24 The Oval, Oval. <br>The Nest, Dalston. <br>Market House, Brixton.

### Monetisation strategy

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/16374/j6ome1siog974ybvfxed3wwm289jv0x/t7.jpg?rect=289%2C12%2C3710%2C2640&w=600&fit=clip&s=bc11f3318d8f9cd33fc5374ad051ac45)

Our venue on Maltby Street Market will act as a flagship site for Dandy. Featuring the best of what we love and what we do: beer, food, coffee and wine. We will open five days per week initially offering an all-day menu. We will open our brewery on the second level of the building in late 2019.

With the security of the flagship Maltby site, Dandy will be able to expand into other business functions to diversify shareholder interest and increase the security of investment in the business. This will include the expansion to multiple sites across London as well as the opening of an on-site brewery to complement our restaurant, sell our product off-trade and to other businesses.

### Use of proceeds

We have secured private investment and will use our own money to purchase the restaurant but would like to offer a percentage of our business to help towards the development of the site and our planned brewery.

Please note we are in the process of applying for SEIS. Once we have received advanced assurance from HMRC, we will mark the campaign as SEIS eligible. <br>

### Build details

Taking full advantage of a 2500 sq. ft archway with 40 ft ceilings, we will design and build a restaurant utilising natural light, inspired by a combination of the industrial nature of the archway and the natural fibres of the original Dandy greenhouse. The site will be delivered in shell condition so the core fit-out will include a new kitchen, bar, extraction and furnishings, all of which will need to be designed and fitted for the space. The second stage of the build will involve setting up a brewery on a mezzanine level above the restaurant.
