## Idea

### Introduction

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/6025/gv9legykaedqwaxf7mp7qfmrdqx831m/Intro.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C4144%2C2811&w=600&fit=clip&s=5e387a1556aa4b3cf3c44e6ea049ce09)

We're a media company capturing the spirit of startup that's sweeping the world, disrupting industries and redefining how people work and live.

Our mission is to be the most authoritative and authentic brand for modern business. And to do it with a fresh attitude. Our plan is to intensify Courier's reach in the coming years. We want to take the print product to cities around the world as well as develop some ambitious digital products.

We've just released our eighth issue but we've already grown from an initial 6,000 copies to 25,000 now reaching approximately 45,000* Londoners.

The magazine is available free in 300 outlets across London and is also sold online and in select newsagents in Europe. Our plan is to extend the frequency and reach of the brand with this investment.

*Print titles use a multiple of between two and five to infer readership from their print circulation. We don’t have specific data of our own to determine our true readership but we take an extremely conservative estimate that every issue is read by average of at least two readers.

### Intended impact

Courier's job is to be an enabling, inspiring and essential media brand for the audience. We're already on our way towards building something that’s synonymous with startup culture and modern business.

Every now and then a fresh media brand emerges that captures the zeitgeist and becomes essential for a large and influential audience. 

Our job is to shine a light on interesting people and companies, themes of disruption and challenger companies as well as inspiring things the most imaginative are doing to make their lives better.

Despite the surge in startup, we believe there is a real vacuum for a voice representing modern business. New tools, new heroes, new infrastructure, new values and a post recession backdrop where starting a business is seen as both possible but also desirable.

Our impact in the future will come from being actively loved, respected and needed by a large group of people in this space, who choose us as the media brand that best represents them.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

Lots. We’ve produced eight issues in two years, creating our own stockist network of 300 outlets in London in the process. We’ve attracted advertisers and already become profitable* on a per issue basis, with advertisers telling us they're drawn to the freshness and authority of Courier.

We’re also increasingly recognised by a broad group of people in politics, media, finance, big business figures and, of course, the startup world. We've built an advisory board that includes people like Rohan Silva (Second Home), Ian Milner (IRIS) and Hussein Kanji (Hoxton Ventures).

In fact, you could ask why we want investment? The answer is speed. We’ve been tweaking the magazine, the brand and our business model over the last two years, and we feel we now have a strong product and a clear and coherent plan. It’s time to capitalise on all that hard work and push hard to achieve the mission.

### Monetisation strategy

The company has been profitable* without any external investment since launch. We posted turnover in excess of £500,000* last year.

We have a model in keeping with that of a modern agile media business. One built on creating the value of the Courier brand, our reach, the authority and authenticity with the audience, and selling advertising, sponsorship and insight to clients looking to reach this increasingly valuable group.

We grew in our first two years through offering services of a typical small agency to clients of all sizes; branding, content creation, etc. It subsidised our initial investment in the magazine.

This year the magazine has started to attract real advertiser interest and has broken into profit in its own right with advertisers including HSBC, Hiscox, KPMG, EE, Virgin Media and Beams. We are increasingly creating custom advertising for our clients.

Our intention is to grow total revenues, but advertising and sponsorship progressively representing the larger share of our overall income in comparison to client services.

### Use of proceeds

The investment we’re seeking in this round will be spent in three areas:

(i) Financing the build out of a proper commercial team to build on our success with media agencies and client direct relationships. We'll sell page advertisements, advertorials and sponsorships within the magazine and strengthen the creative and strategic client services we already offer.

(ii) Recruiting additional editorial and production resource to allow us to increase our print frequency to six issues per year in 2016 and rollout a significantly upgraded digital offering.

(iii) Upgrading our distribution: primarily intensifying our presence in London, but also extending successful trials of paid-for distribution of stockists in Europe.

We expect this activity will lead to a threefold increase in our audience by end 2016.

## Market

### Target market

Courier is read by an interesting mix of urban professionals right across London and around the world. To be clear, Courier is not aimed purely at people in startups, but at a broader group of people fascinated by startup culture, stretching from the creative industries to technology, food, fashion and finance.

We've conducted some informal reader research to give us a sense of who reads Courier. Highlights:

• Our readers are almost evenly split male and female (55%:45% respectively) which is extremely rare for a media brand.

• Around 45% of our readers have started or are starting their own company. Of the remaining 55%, many of our readers intended to start up one day. However a large segment of our audience just enjoy reading the stories of modern business without any clear intention to one day start something themselves.

• The average income of our readers is £42,000pa.

### Characteristics of target market

Business content has jumped from being restricted to specialist industry information to an area of broad appeal. The area of business (in a modern and accessible form) is attracting young, old, both genders as the stories of founders, changing business models and disruption in a variety of sectors driving profound curiosity.

The aspiration to start very modest businesses or epic all conquering ones has now fundamentally entered the mainstream consciousness.

Over 580,000 startups were set up in the UK last year and, in a study in July 2015, Bentley university found 66% of American millennials want to start a business. There are similar signs in the UK and in Europe’s major cities. Anecdotal stories of management consultants, bankers and corporates quitting to start their own, often small, startups are increasingly common.

Suffice to say it’s a phenomenon that’s not going away, and we believe it's one that’s missing a media brand at its heart.

### Marketing strategy

Despite our initial success, we’ve only just scratched the surface in London, let alone around the world.

Our marketing strategy for 2016 is to scale up the distribution of the magazine and grow our presence in existing and new areas.

Courier has a twist on the free print model, where we use a quality print stock, but maintain a very select distribution model as opposed to the carpet bombing of freesheets at train stations. We have built our own network of 300 stockists (and growing) in London, chosen based on where we feel our audience live and work.

It’s allowed us to have neighbourhood-level insight on stockists and observe how and where best to optimise our print runs and distribution. <br>Each issue is read by approximately 45,000* readers based on a per issue print run of 25,000 copies.

Our distribution network has let us rapidly reach a critical mass of readers (according to our calculation we're already read by almost twice as many readers as Monocle in the UK despite only distributing in London). We believe our potential audience in London alone for the print title is in excess of 50,000 copies which would make us bigger than many commercial publications on sale in newsagents and supermarkets.

After promising trials selling Courier in Berlin, Stockholm, Amsterdam and LA, we will establish a stronger foothold in these and other cities next year, as well as execute the first phase of our digital and events plan.

*Print titles use a multiple of between two and five to infer readership from their print circulation. We don’t have specific data of our own to determine our true readership but we take an extremely conservative estimate that every issue is read by average of at least two readers.

### Competition strategy

Business Media is increasingly a highly valued space, with a recent spate of monster investments in titles like FT, Economist, Monocle and Business Insider. We believe these underline the huge importance of trust and affinity with a business brand in today’s noisy media environment. An exciting prospect for us is that as far as we know none of those titles chime with what is arguably the most exciting audience, the most valuable and dynamic space currently available: modern business and startup culture.

Several media businesses have raised large valuations in recent years, proving the value in large and engaged audiences with clear identities.

We believe we are perfectly positioned to build such an audience, one that will be hard to replicate for established groups and other niche players.

Big media groups are burdened by their core editorial focus and fail to talk to the audience in as relevant a way. New challengers starting from scratch will have too much road to cover before they can catch up given the strides we’ve made with our editorial leadership and distribution network.

We’ve found a recipe that has had fantastic traction for an independent startup. Our plan to grow is to stay utterly focussed on delivering authority, authenticity and the Courier attitude. Expanding distribution, new digital products and other launches we’re currently keeping under wraps will grow our leadership in this area.
