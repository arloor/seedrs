## Idea

### Introduction

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/16200/qu652nyq8z6euafycy8af1mpj1r9hjk/PURE-Avocado-Oil-On-Shelf---Tesco-Oct18.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1500%2C949&w=600&fit=clip&s=a18c518fe62030d594887567d2a4cdf7)

At South Press Co, we produce the best value Extra Virgin Avocado Oil available in UK supermarkets today.

Our PURE Avocado Oil is sold in over 500 Tesco stores around the United Kingdom and Ireland, with our South Press Co line available on Amazon.

Roelof, the director's, unique approach to farm-to-table sourcing, consumer trends and marketing innovation has led to various success stories, including Nudo Adopt an olive tree (as seen in New York Times, Oprah, Today Show), Mokhado Oils (Great Taste Awards winner), and the nation-wide launch of 'Taste No 5 Umami' in 2,270 US supermarkets.

Now we’re investing all this deep experience and skills into rapidly growing our Avocado Oil sales and launching our new avocado oil-based healthy snack ranges in the UK and US.

### Intended impact

Unlike more commonly available refined oils, our Extra Virgin Avocado Oil is cold-pressed from the flesh of first grade African avocados, retaining all its natural nutritional goodness, with a lovely green colour and delicious fruity flavour.

We believe customers can actually taste the difference, even when compared to other extra virgin avocado oils.

Seen as the "next big thing" for the £300+ million UK speciality oils category, Avocado Oil is rapidly gaining ground on supermarket shelves here and around the world. Offering the best value in this environment in the UK market gives us the competitive edge in oil sales.

It is however in our new derivative avocado oil-based food products where we see even greater opportunities for exponential growth, including LENTILPOPS® which, to our knowledge, is the UK's first crisps brand made with Avocado Oil.

2019... Beyond Avocado Oil

Interesting fact: many of our Avocado growers also grow the world’s most expensive nut, Macadamia, which means we have a direct sourcing- and price advantage.

Now that we’re overfunding, Pure South Press will apply additional funds to revolutionising this incredible nut with the launch of our delicious new line of Macadamia Nut Extra Virgin oil, Protein Bars and Macadamia Nut Butters in three vegan flavours: simply roasted, cinnamon and chocolate.

### Monetisation strategy

We operate a lean startup model, pressing oil close to source in South Africa and shipping in bulk to the UK where we only produce and distribute to order through our trusted outsourcing partners, ensuring quick stock turnover and thus very efficient use of capital.

We are now focused on maximising returns on our annual harvest yields. This includes:

1. Maximising our bottled oil price in export markets where PURE Avocado oil can both command a higher price and remain the best value brand in that market. This is particularly true for the USA, where we can earn 4x the gross margin as compared to the UK, and also double our annual bottled sales volume.

2. Launching Avocado oil-based food products, where we can maximise our return per ton of oil used as an ingredient. Our first major opportunities are the launch of our new Extra Virgin Avocado Oil blends and cooking sprays, and our new crisps line.

For example: for every ton of oil we produce, we can earn 75x more revenue when used in our LENTILPOPS® crisps as compared to selling the same oil in bottled formats.

### Use of proceeds

LENTILPOPS® <br>We will invest in the upfront packaging, initial manufacture and launch into independent retail of the UK’s first crisps made with Avocado Oil.

This type of product is at the forefront of consumer trends: made from all natural ingredients that are vegan, free from gluten, lactose and soy, low in sugar, a source of fibre, and with 60% less fat than many regular potato crisps.

Already there has been interest in this new snack, particularly from supermarket buyers considering the line for their 2019 listings.

USA LAUNCH <br>Given Roelof's deep experience with American retail, we hope to expand into the US market via online retail in January 2019, whilst preparing for distribution to supermarkets by Summer 2019.

We will put funds towards building up sufficient stock to service new retail accounts in key Eastern, Southern and Mid-Western states.
