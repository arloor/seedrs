## Idea

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/7015/4vyth089s97ayxe4w3me7frgfqs2xwk/Screen_Shot_2016-02-05_at_10.52.17.png?rect=0%2C0%2C841%2C618&w=600&fit=clip&s=0c181ce26bb2c6ed268869b69ea5f338)

### Introduction

The Vampire's Wife is an exciting new fashion brand creating high quality, elegant, original, clothing in vibrant colours - the design vision of Susie Cave, former muse of the great British designers Vivienne Westwood and Bella Freud. <br>Merging marketing techniques more commonly associated with popular culture or streetwear with classic couture, The Vampire’s Wife delivers a high-end fashion brand for women with an effortless buying experience for our customers. <br>Manufactured in England and Poland we will sell online and in selected stores introducing new styles monthly. Utilising the global footprint of Susie Cave’s husband, musician Nick Cave, Susie’s own profile and the legion of people who support them both, we will market via social media and a major worldwide press campaign in September 2016

### Substantial accomplishments to date

Actresses, designers &amp; musicians all form our growing following including actress Cate Blanchett, model Daisy Lowe, designer Charlotte Olympia &amp; model/Vogue contributing editor, Laura Bailey, who regularly wear our clothes on the red carpet. <br>Designed &amp; produced our first capsule collection. <br>Established a presence on social media with near to 4,000 followers on Instagram.

Started to develop a following in the USA and Australia, as well as in many other parts of the world. <br>Cate Blanchett wore our Pink Medici Bell Skirt to the Bafta party. Charlotte Olympia accepted her 'Best Luxury Brand' award wearing the Rose Pink Taffetta Night Garden Dress &amp; has ordered another dress for the British Fashion Awards. <br>Daisy Lowe was voted best dressed at the GQ Men of the Year awards wearing the Red Velvet Night Garden Dress. <br>All of the above are wearing our clothes both on the red carpet and as daywear &amp; regularly commenting on them in social media. This has created a demand for our designs, which we are selling direct to customers prior to having an online store set up or any formal PR strategy in place.

### Monetisation strategy

The Vampire's Wife have built up a core team of highly skilled pattern cutters, machinists and production staff with a strong-shared vision. We have taken our time to build up production experience to ensure we can deliver high quality in good time.

Using our social media platforms and the natural build of interest in our brand and those associated with it we are building a strong base of 'followers' and our aim is to sell 80% of our clothing online, making it instantly a global brand.

Key selected stores worldwide will stock our clothes mostly to raise awareness of the brand and drive business to our online store.

We are working with a manufacturer in Poland who will deliver new pieces monthly, we believe that this will also be at a fraction of the cost of UK competitors with no quality compromise. Commencing in February 2016 a regular monthly shipment (growing along with demand) from Poland will allow us to introduce new styles every month in small quantities, enabling us to utilize our social media platforms to create a buzz and demand amongst our followers.

We have a good, affordable and flexible office space at relatively low cost enabling us to design and manufacture key pieces in house and grow without increased cost

'Online luxury fashion sales are set to grow at a rate of 18% between now and 2018 in the UK and a whopping 70% in China. The way consumers interact with brands is becoming increasingly digitalised, with 50% of UK consumers using search engines to find luxury goods. Online sites provide, according to McKinsey &amp; Company, a rich opportunity to increase sales growth'

### Use of proceeds

Proceeds will go towards direct sales initiatives, purchase of fabrics, our website shop and app, social media and online campaigns, photoshoots and lookbooks to build our campaign in Feburary 2016 and a major worldwide publicity campaign for our launch in September 2016.

The Company has friends and family loans of £154,000 and a business loan of £32,000. None of the proceeds of investment are intended to be used to repay this.

## Market

### Target market

All women of all ages with an interest in beautiful clothes. <br>Tech savvy women who are independent individuals not necessarily served by the high street or high-end couture fashion. <br>As the name suggests, The Vampire’s Wife challenges the status quo, stands out from the norm and aims to provide women of all ages with distinctive, timeless clothes with a flair and a fit that will entice lifelong, committed buyers. <br>.

### Characteristics of target market

The younger generation are very tech-savvy - following trends, emulating style icons &amp; immersed in social media and the older generations now are not necessarily traditional. <br>"Nowadays there’s no such thing as an ‘average consumer’; there is no universal. What we have instead is a mosaic of minorities: lots of different tribes of people, with many people belonging to more than one tribe. For retailers &amp; marketers making assumptions about a person from their looks, gender or age can be extremely dangerous' (source: Columno) <br>In 2013, over half of all women bought clothes online. <br>There are 80m millennials in America, about 1/4 of the entire population, with $200 billion in annual buying power. They have a lot of influence over older generations and are trendsetters across all industries from fashion to food. 50+ women are the healthiest, wealthiest and most active generation of women in history'

### Marketing strategy

Using twitter, instagram, key media influencers such as actresses, models, musicians and fashion icons we have easy access to through Susie and Nick Cave's connections. Those already engaged include Daisy Lowe (275,000 followers on Instagram and recently voted 'best dressed' wearing TheVampire's Wife dress to GQ awards), Laura Bailey (contributing editor to British Vogue (67.5K followers), Charlotte Olympia (44.4k twitter followers), Nick Cave (2.1m followers Facebook + Twitter), Bella Freud &amp; Philip Treacy OBE. <br>Building on these followers using a carefully planned social media campaign. <br>Creating ease of flow and purchase across all social media platforms, apps and online store. <br>Using Susie Cave's modelling career to obtain major fashion press pieces in publications such as W Magazine (USA) , Style.com, The Telegraph, Womenswear Daily (USA) and other major fashion press.

### Competition strategy

By being competitively priced and better quality than the majority of designers. <br>Providing more than one length in each design to suit women of different size, height and age groups. <br>More tech savvy than the majority but taking a lead from marketing techniques of successful brands like Michael Kors and Burberry and embracing more streetwise marketing techniques of street wear labels such as NY based 'Supreme'. <br>Introducing new styles monthly rather than conforming to bi-annual fashion collections and providing designs for all age groups for all seasons all year to make it a truly global brand.
