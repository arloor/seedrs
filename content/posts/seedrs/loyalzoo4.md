## Idea

### Introduction

This is a pre-emption campaign for Loyalzoo who have raised a further £250,005 of funds. As an existing shareholder in Loyalzoo you have the right to exercise your pre-emption rights in order to maintain your current percentage ownership in the business. If you would like to exercise your pre-emption rights, simply click the invest button above and follow the instructions.

Please note that an outstanding loan of £200,010 is being capitalised at this time. Shares will be issued at the price of this round. Your pre-emption rights have been calculated to account for this further issuance of shares and the effect of the loan has been taken into account in the pre-money valuation shown.

This pre-emption campaign will remain open for 10 days after which time you will no longer be able to exercise your pre-emption rights.
