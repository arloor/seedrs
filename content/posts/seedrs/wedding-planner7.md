## Idea

### Introduction

This is a pre-emption campaign for Wedding Planner who have raised a further £32,000 of funds. As an existing shareholder in Wedding Planner you have the right to exercise your pre-emption rights in order to maintain your current percentage ownership in the business. If you would like to exercise your pre-emption rights, simply click the invest button above and follow the instructions.

This pre-emption campaign will remain open for 10 days after which time you will no longer be able to exercise your pre-emption rights.

We are opening this round at £16/share to reflect funds invested offline at this price. If investors take up the full pre-emption allowance, we will open up a new round at £20/share to allow pre-emption on investment raised offline at that price.
