## Idea

### Introduction

The UK is one of the biggest markets for Italian wines (over Â£1.7 billion per year).

Italy has an incredibly interesting variety of grapes and wines: from the well known Pinot Grigio, Prosecco, Nero d'Avola, Primitivo, Barolo, Chianti to hundreds of lesser known but very distinctive ones like Albana, Vermentino, Franciacorta, Barbaresco, Morellino, Falanghina, Greco di Tufo and many more.

Vini Italiani is entirely dedicated to giving UK wine lovers the best Italian wine experience they can get in retail, wine bars and online. We enjoy a multi-channel revenue approach: wine bars/stores, online and wholesale all focused on helping the UK market appreciate and discover the huge variety and quality of our wines.

The founding team (all Italian wine lovers) believe that by having an undivided focus on Italian wines the company can build a brand which will be recognised and identified as the leader in promoting and commercialising Italian wines in the UK.

This is a pre-emption campaign made available to existing shareholders only and so limited information is provided.
