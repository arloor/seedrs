# [Capital Pilot](https://www.seedrs.com/capital-pilot)

## Idea

### Introduction

We are raising between Â£60-100k in order to have some working capital while revenue ramps up, do a phased, modest technology spend to build out the platform, marketing and PR, build the core team and regional representation, become fully regulated, and to develop new proprietary tools and resources.

This is a purely private investment round being made available to acquaintances of the company only and so limited information is being provided.

Any documents or information prepared and provided by the company to investors has not been reviewed or approved by Seedrs.

Further information is available in the documents available for download (which are not verified or approved by Seedrs).
