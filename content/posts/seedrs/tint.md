## Idea

### Introduction

TINT. provides universal access to some of the world’s best in yoga education, partnering with leading yoga pioneers to offer classes online. Using the TINT. website, yogis can stream videos to practice yoga and deepen their knowledge.

TINT. was founded by Young Ho Kim, one of Europe’s and Asia’s yoga superstars. Being frustrated with dangerous and superficial yoga videos on the web, he decided to do something about it. He activated his network - famous teachers that had become long-term friends, sharing his values - to bring their combined know-how onto one single platform.

Over 6,500 users have joined us already. Since our website relaunch in October 2017 more than 30,000 video sessions have been streamed on our website from 90+ countries. TINT. has been featured in 17 publications and we are working with Lufthansa to feature online yoga content accessible in Lufthansa Lounges.

Join our global movement with the mission to spread health and happiness.

### Intended impact

We’ve built TINT. to enable people around the world to learn yoga in a healthy and proper way. Our CEO created a FYBY platform - For Yogis by Yogis - that is more than just a business, it's a community.

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/15209/o8m1ux351jlymr3ciboro8ql370r103/03_INTENDED-IMPACT_Testimonials.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C600%2C323&w=600&fit=clip&s=b5ad3d1c380285bca49f0683b9c0ff7e)

Online yoga has become a growing global trend with a large number of different websites. But we believe that the vast variety on offer makes it impossible for the consumer to distinguish quality amongst the masses. We consider that a large part of what is available online is dangerous: superficial knowledge and incorrect practice can cause serious harm.

TINT. on the other hand aims to offer: <br>• promise of quality. <br>• prudent &amp; safe content. <br>• content directly from the source. <br>• easy access.

We believe that knowledge is crucial for developing a profound understanding of your body and physical health but building strong customer relationships goes beyond this. With free live classes and events weʼve set the first brick in building a community of like-minded movers. Users will have the ability to share their <br>thoughts and learnings, and become part of an engaging and caring environment.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

We piloted our platform in August 2016, released a further developed beta version in April 2017 and fully launched in October 2017. Here are some of our accomplishments:

Additionally, we partnered with other great companies to expand our international reach:

Lufthansa Yoga@Lounge

TINT. is cooperating with Lufthansa to encourage healthy travelling. “All lounge guests have access to yoga relaxation exercises via the LoungeNet, which are adapted to the conditions in the lounge. Via a link the guests can watch practical application videos and easily copy the exercises in an armchair in the lounge.” (Press Release, Lufthansa).

TINT. Korea

We have signed a partnership with a local partner in Korea to launch a Korean version of our website in July 2018 and build an app for yoga studios to manage their members.

Cooperation in China

We have recently signed a cooperation with Daily Yoga - one of the biggest Chinese yoga platforms with 42 million users - who approached us because of their interest to work together with our popular CEO.

### Monetisation strategy

B2C. <br>Currently we generate 100% of our revenues on our website by selling online yoga videos. The user has two options:

1) Buy single products for a one-off fee and get lifetime access to the purchased videos. <br>2) Monthly subscription ($25 per month) with access to our entire (full) video library.

We are committed to offer great value-for-money to our users.

B2B2C. <br>We intend to cooperate with local partners in specific jurisdictions and geographic areas, especially Asia, that are driven by totally different dynamics and tech tools. We are about to launch tintyoga.kr and have just signed a deal with Chinese Daily Yoga, given the CEO’s strong network and public presence in Korea.

B2B. <br>We plan to offer more tailor-made yoga and fitness videos to corporates for either their customers or employees. Highlighted by our work with Lufthansa, we believe companies are becoming increasingly interested in health and fitness topics as well as working with a quality brand in the industry.

### Use of proceeds

Raising with Seedrs serves two main purposes:

1) Fuel the next step in our aim of becoming the biggest premium brand in the industry. We believe that we've proven the business model, now it's key to grow our reach and revenues.

2) Give all users, teachers and followers the opportunity to invest in the company. TINT. is not just a business case: It’s a community - For Yogis By Yogis.

We plan to use proceeds as follows and hope to break-even in the near future:

Marketing: <br>We intend to increase advertising on performance marketing channels like Facebook and Google. As current customer acquisition costs are not higher than our 6-month customer value, we have generated effective growth in this area.

Platform development: <br>We intend to develop new features like advanced video-search and user-specific training guides. Further, we expect that a new blog and free video library will help us to step up from an online shop to a full yoga experience platform.

Team &amp; organization: <br>To support increased volume we will invest in the team and organisation (marketing, tech, operations, salary and customer support).

### Notices

Share Price

Please note that the share price for this round is €91.30. Due to this share price, we have decided to allow investors to hold fractional shares. This means that we have reduced the investment multiple to €18.26 (representing 0.2 of a share). As these shares will be held via the Seedrs Nominee, fractional entitlements are possible. In the event that shares were to be transferred out of the nominee structure, TINT would take the steps required to subdivide its shares so that fractional entitlements result in whole shares.

Loans

Please note, that TINT currently has 13 individual loans in the form of Participatory Rights Agreements in place, totalling €335,000. Each Agreement includes the right to a profit share of 1.0% per €1,000 of TINT.'s net yearly profit. Each Agreement also includes a fixed interest amount of 1% p.a on the loaned amount. None of the funds raised on Seedrs will be used to pay back this debt.

## Market

### Target market

We focus on dedicated yoga students that care for content and quality. They are estimated to represent about 28% of the yogi customer base of 300 million yogis worldwide as 59% of the yogis are enthusiasts who practice more than once a week and 48% value the quality of instruction. Within this “premium submarket” we have proven to be successful in attracting yogis from a variety of segments and countries and we plan to penetrate this specific market further.

The existing population of all loyal followers of our yoga pioneers provide a major benefit to our business. These pioneers have been teaching endless numbers of students and have built large communities in real life and on social media. The buzz that our teachers create in their communities attracts new customers to the platform on a regular basis.

### Competition strategy

The global online yoga market is highly fragmented. Being a new industry, we believe that none of the leading players has a significant market share. The competitive landscape is crowded in the low-price segment, focusing on mass markets.

![](https://seedrs.imgix.net/uploads/startup/section_image/image/15226/a2v2uxwb35tdyax7c5v2hgk0zkase1e/10_COMPETITION-STRATEGY_Competitor-Matrix.png?rect=0%2C0%2C598%2C400&w=600&fit=clip&s=b6fc7ff9c0b454637c0dcfc084168582)

We believe that the quality differentiation allows us to provide superior value to customers at a fair price, creating a win-win scenario that we believe will boost the overall profitability and viability of our business.

Our competitor strategy is as follows:

Quality guarantee - Through our relentless preselection we are able to offer prudent and safe content for every level of experience. We develop products that support yogis throughout their whole yoga journey.

Customers matter – TINT. is a platform for yogis, built by yogis (FYBY). We meet our customers' needs and witness high acceptance and positive reviews amongst our target group. Yogis identify themselves with our brand and philosophy.

Direct source of knowledge - We offer first-hand knowledge from the leading teachers of the world. Our unique portfolio creates value by enabling us to charge a premium price that is greater than the extra cost incurred by differentiation.

Young Ho Kim - Our CEO has achieved tremendous successes over the last two decades and we built on top of them. His exclusive and valuable network, his public presence and his in-depth knowledge allow for a headstart in our industry.

We don’t target the entire market. It’s evident that not everybody has the desire to train with the best. However, for all yoga enthusiasts out there who strive for quality and first-hand knowledge we believe we are the platform of choice.
