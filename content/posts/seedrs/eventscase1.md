## Idea

### Introduction

EventsCase provides all in one event management software. We increase attendance at events thanks to our networking/community tools, generate and keep relevant data and decrease supplier costs, but the main reason we are purchased is because we save the clients time and achieve more. EventsCase has raised Â£694,750 and is now allowing investors to participate on a pro rata basis via this campaign. As this campaign is for existing investors only, limited information is being provided at this time.
