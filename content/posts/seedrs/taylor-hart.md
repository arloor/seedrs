## Idea

### Introduction

Taylor &amp; Hart is excited to announce that we have secured £935,000 of seed funding over the course of 2018 lead by our existing VC Launchub and new investors Garage Soho (lead by advertising maven Sir John Hegarty and serial VC Tom Teichman). Over the coming months we will be working closely with the team at Garage Soho to establish Taylor &amp; Hart as a world leading jewellery brand. We would now like to extend our existing Seedrs investors the opportunity to exercise their pre-emption rights and continue to join us on this journey.

Taylor &amp; Hart is a fast-growing online retailer of bespoke engagement rings and fine diamond jewellery. With the aim of making bespoke jewellery products affordable and accessible. Taylor &amp; Hart offers a tech-enabled bespoke design service online, and in-person at our London showroom.

Our consultants provide expert advice, helping customers to find the best value diamond available from over 150,000 ethically sourced options and to create a personalised piece of jewellery on our platform. This can range from something adventurous and unique to a subtle change to a classic design.

Customers can experience their design before they purchase by viewing 3D browser based renders (photos) or through a 3D printed resin replica. Our London enquiries convert 3x better than those from other regions. We attribute this to the benefit of them getting personalised advice and seeing rings in-person at our showroom. Taylor &amp; Hart already sells in Europe, the US and UK with revenues of £1.85m in 2017* and £2.71m in the last 12 months to end of August.
