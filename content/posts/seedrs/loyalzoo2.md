## Idea

### Introduction

As detailed in our regular investor updates, Loyalzoo is experiencing good success and exceptional growth opportunities ahead, not only with the Worldpay relationship, but with many other planned projects in the pipeline.

As part of a financial agreement arranged with an existing shareholder two years ago, the three founders of the business (Mark Ryan, Gregor Dobbie and Massimo Sirolla) have had to sell a small part of their personal Loyalzoo shares to that investor, and have decided to use that money to re-invest into the company at a valuation of £20 per share, or £6,609,640 pre-money valuation. The amount re-invested is £155,000.

As a result of this share issue, since you are an existing shareholder in Loyalzoo, you have the right to exercise your pre-emption rights under the same terms, in order to maintain your current percentage ownership in the business.

### Use of proceeds

- engage with a senior payment industry consultant in the USA to carry through on our strategy of building partnerships with key US merchant acquirers. <br> - marketing activities including participation in industry events and conferences. <br> - additional PR activities.
