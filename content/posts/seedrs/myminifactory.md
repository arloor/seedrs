## Idea

### Introduction

MyMiniFactory is a leading 3D printable object-sharing platform, where 12,000 Creators and Brands upload and share more than 55,000 free and paid unique, beautiful and functional high quality digital files. These digital blueprints are tested to 3D print on affordable desktop 3D printers.

MyMiniFactory has a signed term sheet for a Â£2,000,000 investment from Velocity Capital Advisors and is now allowing investors to participate on a pro rata basis via this campaign. The investment is expected to complete in the coming weeks, subject to agreeing final terms and the completion of due diligence. As this is a preemption campaign open only to existing investors, limited information is being provided at this time.
