## Idea

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/13953/7b7ntxm9hmehowx6jnkeb3xhd8du0ak/introduction-img.png?rect=0%2C-3%2C820%2C462&w=600&fit=clip&s=fd0eed2fcff7ee093ffb4677b2702d63)

### Introduction

University Compare displays university statistics, student reviews and personalised choices to help students decide which course to choose when applying to university. Our service helps sixth-formers make a better-informed decision through a suite of tools before entering into Higher Education.

We work with many universities, ranging from Russell Group (top 15 universities) to University Alliance (universities typically ranked 50+).

We are comfortably generating a six-figure incoming revenue. We aim to be cash flow positive in the next 6 months.

We will shortly release our brand new app: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="outside" href="https://universitycompare.com/download/app/">https://universitycompare.com/download/app/</a>

### Intended impact

Many students today are unsure of the benefits of applying to university and are not aware of the opportunities available for them. Many students have consistently struggled to find external support outside of their school, and University Compare addresses this problem.

The government's Browne review considered the balance of contributions to universities by taxpayers, students, graduates, and employers, with the result being that student fees should be increased to £9k per annum (+/- U.K. inflation rate), and government contributions direct to universities have reduced dramatically.

Universities are now under greater financial pressure to fill places to cover their costs, and this is creating a more competitive marketplace.

We're able to offer a realistic perspective on the university experience. University Compare specialises in gaining reviews from former and current students who share their experiences online; they give a great insight into university life, similar to the reviews on TripAdvisor.

### Monetisation strategy

Current revenue streams:

- Annual Subscription (featured university listing) for universities. <br>- Annual Subscription (featured course listing) for universities. <br>- Social advertising for universities/companies. <br>- Email advertising campaigns for universities/companies. <br>- Cost per referral in Clearing, £50 per connected lead. <br>- Data CPA's for student-related companies, i.e. marketing to our users to encourage registrations elsewhere.

Additional revenue streams we plan to implement in 2018:

- University open day bookings £50 per connection. <br>- App-based marketing, features and referrals, custom quotes. <br>- European agency recruitment, helping EU students into UK universities

We have hit our previously projected revenue targets outlined in our previous funding round held by Seedrs, showcasing realistic and scalable targets. We moved sales resources to focus on user growth in 2017, growing to 75,000 registered users, instead of our forecasted 16,000 total users. We see growing the user base and increasing customer engagement as a stronger long-term strategy to increase our market share.

### Use of proceeds

The company has stayed extremely lean over the past 12 months, our average monthly cost at £15,750 PCM. This includes 4 full-time staff, consultants/freelancers, product development and a marketing/advertising budget. The company has no outstanding debts/loans.

Estimated costs for year 1: <br>£113,000 Salaries (Incl. NI/Tax). <br>£40,500 Product development. <br>£206,750 Marketing. <br>£17,800 G&amp;A.

£378,050 = Total spend

Estimated costs for year 2: <br>£203,000 Salaries (Incl. NI/Tax). <br>£53,625 Product development. <br>£171,250 Marketing. <br>£25,500 G&amp;A.

£453,375 = Total spend

Note: The marketing budgets supplied above are a maximum spend and will scale proportionately to the sales generated.

Upon reaching our goal, within 2 years we can continue to build the core business, continuing our successful entry into the UK undergraduate market along with a small EU market share; students looking to study outside of the UK.

Any additional employees will be placed predominately into sale-based roles and any changes in salary will be performance based only.

## Market

### Target market

We are a B2C service that sells B2B products. Targeting prospective students between the ages of 16-24, who are looking to study in Higher Education.

We aim to reach 150,000 registered students in 2018 (100% increased from today), and when we achieve this, we will begin extending our target market to postgraduate study adding an additional revenue stream, allowing a strong entry-to-market from the students who have used our services in the past (2015-2017) and will now, be graduating.

We own other domains, including studyphd.com, whatcourse.net which could both offer unique services should we consider an alternative media outlet other than universitycompare.com.

University Compare has collected 185+ Trust Pilot with an average rating of 9.5/10, and some of our past users have expressed their gratitude:

" Such a great tool for helping people find out exactly what they need from a company!! Reviews are so specific, and I've saved so much money and time as a result! It's like TripAdvisor but for unis! " <br>- Danny Hutcheson.

### Characteristics of target market

As our market matures, so should we and it's important that we follow the research data that we collect because as we sign up more students, we naturally have an entry-to-market into graduate recruitment.

University Compare aims to collect more than 1m+ data records of students by January 2019. We’ll know; graduation years, course interests, email, mobile, etc. of each user and will be able to directly offer jobs that would interest them at the opportune time, generating a higher conversion.

A portion of this market will move into postgraduate study. Students are increasingly taking on postgraduate degrees at University, a rise from 22% from 2015/16 to 2016/17. Uni Compare has the client relationships in place and will be able to generate further sales in this market with existing universities.

The management team is strategically placed via existing investors to make this opportunity a smooth transition and also open up a series of revenue streams through the characteristics of this target market.

### Marketing strategy

University Compare looks to entice users to make a university-application decision when using our service using the tools that we provide to offer a more in-depth view for students.

Many of these students use our service to view more than 10 opportunities throughout the 12-16 week period as they search, compare and save their opportunities.

1 in 3 of our users calls a university to connect throughout Clearing, which is chargeable to the university at a base referral price of £50, resulting in 121x return our acquisition investment.

### Competition strategy

Our competitors sell advertising space that does not allow institutes to directly engage with high-value prospects. University Compare is in a position to offer either solution, should they wish to stick to their current advertising campaigns.

We have identified our competitors in our Investment Deck and have provided side-by-side comparisons on URL Strength, Domain Rating, and an overall SEO rank. We run a competitor analysis every week and keep a regular tab on our competitors so we're able to stay well-informed of any changes that may introduce.

To our knowledge, we are the only service that offers an app-based model and are the leading provider in this area with 22% of the addressable market using our service in 2016, and 30% in 2017. Not only are we first to market, but we also have an innovative, refined service that is set for mass scalability.

We identify our key competitors as; Whatuni.com, Studenthut.com, Applytouni.com and comparetheuni.com.
