## Idea

### Introduction

Wealth Migrate is a global online property marketplace that allows people to invest &amp; diversify in global property for as little as $1,000 (soon to be $100).

THE PROBLEM <br>The property market is worth $217tn, and currently, there is no means for the majority of the global population to invest effectively in this asset class. We aim to help the 99% invest like the top 1% in global property, economically, safely &amp; simply, using technology &amp; SMART Investing. Our purpose is to solve the Wealth Gap. Here's how - <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="outside" href="https://bit.ly/2POLA40">https://bit.ly/2POLA40</a>

BUSINESS SUMMARY <br>We enable investors to access yields of 7-12% in the US, UK, &amp; Australia. Our global property marketplace allows local &amp; international investors to invest as little as $1k in property opportunities without any of the hassle, management issues, foreign bank accounts &amp; complex tax structures. We achieve this by partnering with developers, asset managers, &amp; property investment trusts (REIT's) to supply a curated inventory of property assets.

### Intended impact

MARKET OPPORTUNITY

Our research has shown that 49% of the world's wealth is held in property and yet only 12.9% of the world's population has access to this. Of this 12,9% in the Western World, less than 1% actually retire wealthy. The system is broken and we want to change this by allowing the 99% to invest like the 1%, using technology &amp; SMART Investing.

Wealth Migrate’s mission is to disrupt the global property industry by focusing on three areas: the explosive middle class growth in emerging markets, their growing internet &amp; mobile adoption, &amp; what we perceive as a desire to invest in first world opportunities. This middle class target market is predicted to grow by 60% in the next 10 years, that's another 2bn people, while global cross-border capital flow continues to increase year on year (e.g. China 18% increase YOY, India 500% increase YOY). We are targeting a $100m in revenue within six years by achieving 1m transactions per year, with an average of $2k per investment and average 5% fee on equity, monetising supply and demand side.

### Monetisation strategy

BUSINESS MODEL <br>Wealth Migrate generates revenue on the demand side via equity raising fees (3%), investment management (2%) and exit (3%). Revenue for 2017 was $1.5m via 846 transactions. As we drop the minimum investment requirement, we intend to increase this by the end of the year from a current 533 transactions to 2000 transactions, with the aim to deliver increased revenue and profitability, driven by a wider the investment focus to other property &amp; digital products and providing multiple ways to invest.

We plan to optimise the business model for scale, from being solely origination focused to providing a marketplace that matches investors with vetted partner projects. Finally, we currently generate revenue by monetising the demand side, and we plan to evolve to monetise the supply side as the marketplace evolves &amp; network effects are realised. We already have our first subscription property partner signed up &amp; plan to expand this aggressively in late 2018 &amp; 2019.

The Wealth University &amp; Wealth Movement add additional diversified revenue streams

### Use of proceeds

CUSTOMER BASE <br>In order to enable emerging markets to invest in global property opportunities, the minimum investment has steadily declined from $100k to $1k. As the technology improves, the friction costs will reduce which allows the minimum investment to continue to decrease. We have five main distribution strategies – Education Based Marketing; Channel Partners; Digital Marketing; Word of Mouth and Marketplace roll-out. Increasing marketing spend by 10x, we intend to increase our member base to 56k members &amp; produce 5,600 transactions with an average size of $15k per transaction in 2019.

There are 4 major focus areas for use of proceeds:

- CAPEX – Investment in the Platform &amp; IT – 40% <br>- Digital products, Branding &amp; Marketing – 20% <br>- Human capacity &amp; OPEX - 20% <br>- Deal origination &amp; Marketplace Roll-out – 20%.

In simple terms we have been under the radar proving the model, with limited property partners &amp; now we are really building the team &amp; technology to scalable rapidly.

NOTE TO INVESTORS: Some investors reflected in this campaign have invested an total of US$962,314.58 at a share price of US$1.50. For this campaign, we have used the fixed FX rate of 0.77052 to convert this to the equivalent share price in GBP, and reflected £737,774.45.

## Market

### Target market

For as long as humans have accumulated wealth, land &amp; property has been a major vehicle for growing &amp; preserving wealth. Whether you are a rice farmer in China, a rickshaw driver in India, a goat herder in Africa or an investment banker in London, we believe that every single person on the planet understands the intrinsic value of property, whether they have access or not.

Our market is clear and is defined in a 3-phase process: <br>1. Phase One: HNW, Professionals and Middle Class who are investing internationally to migrate &amp; preserve their wealth. It is all about diversification. <br>2. Phase Two: Middle Class who are investing locally to create wealth in property. <br>3. Phase Three: A marketplace where everyone can participate, either locally or internationally. This is positively enhanced with a tablet/mobile-based education system which empowers individuals &amp; helps affiliates &amp; partners monetise their networks, allowing viral growth and network effects.

### Characteristics of target market

The global middle class is set to increase by 160m each year, for the next 5 years, while global cross-border capital flow continues to increase YOY.

Capital flows from emerging to the first world markets see billions of USD moving annually, seeking first world assets. Between 2010 and 2015, $93 billion was pledged by foreign investors in residential property in the US. The UK is no different with European, Chinese, Indian, Russian, Middle Eastern &amp; other foreign investors investing, with international buyers purchasing 13% of all London's newly built homes between 2014 and 2016.

Added to this, many millennials are being kept out of the property market. The average age of a UK first time buyer is now 44. Using technology British locals can now access the best investment opportunities, locally &amp; abroad.

Imagine demand when anyone, anywhere, can invest any amount, in top quality global property, like London, simply &amp; safely.

### Marketing strategy

In order to enable anyone to invest in global property opportunities, the minimum investment has steadily declined from $100k to $1k. As the technology improves, the friction costs reduce which allows the minimum investment to continue to decrease, to the vision of a minimum of $1.

Our main distribution strategies are; Education Based Marketing; Channel Partners; Digital Marketing; and Word of Mouth. Wealth Migrate has a simple model which involves 3 steps for investors to trust and invest with us:.

1. EDUCATION – through the Wealth University we provide the most advanced global property training system with an individual focus for beginners, intermediate, advanced and highly sophisticated investors.

2. TRUST - to strive to be part of our Wealth Inner Circle where investors will have access to everything we do.

3. INVEST- Once the trust is built, we provide complete transparency to help investors make SMART decisions to help them decide what is best for their future.

### Competition strategy

The archaic property industry is in the midst of a technology revolution, with over 100 platforms worldwide. However, all other property platforms are built for in-country deals only. To our knowledge, Wealth Migrate is the only solution that was designed &amp; launched as a global platform. We have solved the global complexity of regulations &amp; banking, &amp; we ensure global compliance through Collaborative SMART Investing. We already operate on five continents &amp; offer diversity in first world markets.

3 main aspects set Wealth Migrate apart from the competition:

1. A vast property knowledge &amp; pipeline of deals. <br>2. It is a thriving business, with existing teams on the ground in 5 continents, &amp; coordinated plan to streamline business through further blockchain integration. <br>3. The team at Wealth Migrate have been able to build the company to where it is today through resilience and ingenuity.

We see other platforms as potential partners, providing them a global solution.
