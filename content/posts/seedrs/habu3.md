## Idea

### Introduction

This campaign is only open to previous investors in Habu.

Habu has recently raised a new round of financing and as such are offering the opportunity to pre-empt on this. Brief details on the business are found below:

Habu is software powering coworking hubs &amp; and a new generation of flexible workspaces that are opening up around the world.

Our mission is twofold. On the one hand, Habu is all about making managing bookings and building buzzing spaces a whole lot easier for those overworked space managers. And on the other, it’s is about improving the onboarding of new members and their day-to-day experience of a hub. What matters to our customers (space managers) is that they’ve got lots of customers (members) and that they’re happy. That’s why we created Habu. It’s beautifully designed to make managing bookings, payments and spaces quick and effortless.

We now have more than 45 customers around the world in 14 different countries.
