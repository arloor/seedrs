## Idea

### Introduction

Orbital Witness is looking for investors to bring its concept developed during MDR LAB to life. We are a "SpaceTech meets LegalTech meets PropTech" startup seeking funding to help us deliver a market-ready product in Q1 2018, offering key features validated through working alongside Mishcon de Reya's real estate department.

Orbital Witness is using high-resolution historical satellite imagery to provide a new perspective for due diligence in real estate. Our product will provide lawyers with unprecedented access to satellite imagery archives digitally overlaid with critical information about properties, including title, boundary and planning data. This will help lawyers work more efficiently with complex information and spot risks earlier into a deal before the client incurs further transactional costs, ensuring a better client service and improved margins for law firms. Orbital Witness plans to deploy computer vision techniques to automatically flag potential risks to users, reducing the scope for human error and allowing lawyers to focus their time on providing strategic advice to clients.

Orbital Witness was selected from more than 100 applicants to take part in Mishcon de Reya's MDR LAB LegalTech incubator, where they worked closely with the real estate department to validate their concept and define user requirements. Since then, the company has gone from strength to strength, being selected by the Land Registry and Ordnance Survey as one of just 3 PropTech startups to take part in their Geovation programme, and winning an international challenge of more than 130 startups to be selected by Airbus as the most promising startup using satellite imagery. <br> <br>Orbital Witness is currently in product build mode, and, with several large law firms already booked in for trials, should be ready to start giving demos of their product in the new year. We intend to use all funding raised in this pre-seed round for product development.
