## Idea

### Introduction

R5 is a new institutional Liquidity pool for eNDFâ€™s and EMFX, which focuses on leading the market change from voice to screen in BRICS and N-11 currency trading.

Today these currencies are traded and fixed over a number of old, difficult to track and inefficient methods. The market is opaque and liable to imperfect price movements to the detriment of both banks and their customers. R5 is building a trading system for FX banks that specialises in the fast growing transaction volumes in BRIC and emerging economy currencies.

This investment opportunity is being offered to (i) existing shareholders in the company and (ii) a select group of investors who are categorised on Seedrs as self-certified sophisticated investors or high-net- worth investors. Therefore, limited information is being provided as part of this campaign.

Any documents or information prepared and provided by the company to investors which does not form part of the campaign has not been reviewed or approved by Seedrs.
