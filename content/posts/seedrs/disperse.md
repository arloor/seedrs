## Idea

### Introduction

Disperse.io provides an actionable, real-time data feed that allows businesses to dynamically adjust to change of crowd flow. We are a data services provider and charge on a subscription model, with a base level service and add-ons to expand capabilities such as real-time feed and the event triggered alert system. Our technology solution is intended to transform the way organisations conduct business - with crowd flow data integrated into operational, marketing and safety platforms. Through real-time and predictive data, such as queue length and flow paths, we aim to save organisations millions in redevelopment costs, increase customer satisfaction, and ensure crowd safety.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only for existing shareholders, minimum details are being provided. More information on Disperse is available on the company's website. Please note, this information has not been verified or approved by Seedrs.
