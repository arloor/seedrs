## Idea

### Introduction

Our Mishergas model will aim to produce a constant supply of 8 MW per hour of green energy which is enough for 15,000 homes. We intend to do this by turning waste tyres into electricity using self-sustaining, environmentally friendly technology. We believe this not only solves a problem of waste tyres and pollution but also reduces the need for mining, fracking &amp; dependence on fossil fuels. Unlike the fluctuations of supply with wind and solar, we can supply electricity round the clock and plan to recover the oil, carbon black &amp; steel which are also saleable commodities. We therefore feel that Mishergas is both green and has a great business model.

As this is a pre-emption round available only to existing shareholders, limited information on the company is being provided at this time.
