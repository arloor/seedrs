# [Blurrt](https://www.seedrs.com/blurrt)

## Idea

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/5631/cjhjm1x5lhsdte82dw9mzqeggatfby4/thumb_blurrt-cover-03.png?rect=2%2C0%2C367%2C208&w=600&fit=clip&s=2ea1cae5ea992013a0edd65fefeb86ab)

### Introduction

There are numerous challenges for anyone seeking to make sense of social data: to collect what is relevant; filter out the noise; conduct an analysis of the data; find out what influencers are saying or simply pick out the most re-tweeted picture of a celeb. Blurrt enables all this to happen - from the serious to the trivial.

Blurrt is a social media analytics platform which allows customers to understand social conversations, through: <br>- Curation of data: collecting, filtering, analysing and displaying social data; <br>- Making overall sense of audience reaction; <br>- Identifying hotspots in the conversation and key contributors / influencers; <br>- Showcasing interesting content; &amp; <br>- An easy to use platform operating in real time.

### Intended impact

TV <br>We believe that Blurrt is a must have tool for the broadcast media industry to exploit the social TV space. Shows like the X Factor can get thousands of tweets by the minute. You need a tool like Blurrt to capture all these tweets. <br> <br>Blurrt Insights allows producers to surface audience generated content quickly and easily: <br>- for online/second screen use; <br>- for show sponsors; <br>- for social engagement; &amp; <br>We do this in real time, 24/7.

Our Live app allows producers of live shows/events to tap into real time social conversations about the show/event. Our easy to use app allows real time tweets or graphics to be used on-screen and to run live Twitter hashtag polls.

We help broadcast media engage with their audience with compelling social content.

Advertising/Brands <br>Blurrt allows brands and advertising agencies to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaign.

We are able to track reactions to advertising campaigns in real time allowing brands and Ad agencies to react and make informed decisions almost immediately.

Our insights allow agencies to test audience reactions and shape the future direction of their campaigns accordingly.

### Use of proceeds

Sales - we intend to recruit sales people across broadcast &amp; advertising.

Marketing/PR - we intend to recruit an internal PR/Marketing manager &amp; work with agencies to publicise what we do &amp; how we add value.

Technical Development - we need to stay ahead of competitors &amp; that requires continual technical development of the platform.

People - we need to invest further in our existing staff and recruit in a number of areas as above. <br> <br>Market - we need to research international markets &amp; other vertical markets beyond broadcast media/advertising/brands.

## Market

### Target market

The strategy for sales will focus on 4 main segments in the UK market, specifically TV entertainment, sport, news and advertisers/brands. Whilst all related in terms of how customers might use our platform, each segment will derive different benefits from its use.

TV Entertainment <br>This segment captures the reality and talent shows, game and panel shows, chat shows and potentially serial dramas. We believe that our ability to surface new and unique content will be attractive to the secondary shows (Xtra Factor, Britain’s Got More Talent) which have more flexible formats and are looking to engage with core fans). We also see opportunities for second screen and online uses which may represent additional benefits to sponsors.

Sport <br>Sport represents a major opportunity for us across a number of fronts. The Insight and Live products have clear application in the broadcast area for those programmes delivering commentary on specific games or events. In addition the platform can give valuable information and insight to sponsors and teams across a whole range of issues and provide a structure within which they can have engaging conversations with their fan base.

News &amp; Current Affairs <br>In this segment our Live product is particularly relevant enhanced by its ease of use, speed and flexibility.

Advertising &amp; Brands <br>We already have experience in surfacing consumer reaction to new advertising and to potential issue management where there may have been brand impact. However, we believe there is a broader opportunity in this segment to both provide insight into consumer behaviour and response to brand messages as well as potential to provide brands, sponsors and advertisers with more effective engagement in their social media marketing and communication.

### Characteristics of target market

We believe that Social TV is set to take the broadcasting industry by storm. Social TV is the coalition of television and social media where new formats are being developed to enhance viewer engagement and encourage new revenue streams. The overall social TV market is forecast to be $256bn by 2017, which we believe analytics and social content will likely account for a growing percentage of. This is a rapidly evolving market which we believe offers considerable potential for those who can make sense of it. The competition in the social TV space is split in our view into analytics around audience measurement and platforms to enable interaction with the audience on screen in real time. Blurrt is the only platform to our knowledge that addresses both of these markets at present.

### Marketing strategy

TV &amp; Entertainment <br>In this segment we have targeted both producers and broadcasters, initially focusing on the big established shows. Presentations have been made to FremantleMedia/Syco for X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent, Endemol and Channel 5 for Big Brother and ITV for a variety of third party and in house productions. In addition we have recently identified and secured an introduction into the BBC group responsible for the oversight of our type of activity.

Sport <br>In sport we are also targeting producers and broadcasters initially. Our connections with the Welsh broadcasters have allowed us to develop some compelling case study material to use when developing specific solutions for our clients. We are looking to use the same model as for our entertainment output although, due to the length of some of the sports seasons and the need to collect information throughout the year we may end up being able to secure annual contracts. <br>Key targets in this area include Sky Sports, given both the breath of their coverage and their exclusive rights, equally BT Sports along with all the terrestrial broadcasters. We are currently building both case study materials and creative proposals and aiming to secure introductions into each of our target organisations.

Advertising/Brands <br>From work we have already conducted for Alcohol Concern and Go Compare, we know that our platform has application and demonstrable value in the advertising and brand space. Specifically we have been able to track consumer reactions to and engagement with brands, sponsorship and advertising. Our forecast assumes we secure an anchor partner from the advertising or media agency sector and also one from the PR arena. These partnerships would help us develop our product offering, give us access to potential clients and provide us with a level of revenue stability
