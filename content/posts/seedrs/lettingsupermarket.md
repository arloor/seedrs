### Introduction

Investments of £25,000 or more will qualify for property management free of charge, whilst these shares are held, for up to 10 properties.

Lettingsupermarket.com, established in August 2012, is an ARLA registered national online letting agency developed to provide the personal service of a high street agency whilst benefiting from the cost saving of an online agent saving clients up to 66% over the high street.

Partnered with one of the leading landlord property forums in the UK we have spent the last three years tailoring our service and systems to create a platform for robust expansion.

We provide a fully comprehensive letting and management service at a market leading rate of 4% + Vat.

Qualified inventory clerks provide local support to landlords and tenants in terms of viewings, check in/out, periodic inspections etc. Our agents are self-employed, which keeps overheads low enough for the business model to be profitable despite charging up to 66% less than the market norm.

### Intended impact

Lettingsupermarket.com provide a comparable service to the high street on a national scale. Many of our landlord clients “tested” us with one or two properties in the early stages.

Clause 24 of the Finance Bill is set to hit letting agents hard over the coming years, with landlords looking to dispose of properties or to reduce costs. The campaigning via Property118 is driving many more landlords to Property118, hence their accelerated growth, and most of those landlords are looking to cut costs. As one of the most cost effective letting agencies in the UK, we are confident the cashflow effects of Clause 24 to be experienced by landlords will drive significant growth of our business and increase our market share.

There is a clear consumer trend with the increase in online agencies in recent years with our competitors Easyproperty being valued at £66 million and Rentify, Emoov and Estates Direct all being valued at £20 million.

With our systems working efficiently following three years of ironing out any issues and with our management portfolio doubling in size year on year we believe it feasible to take on and manage an additional 1000+ properties in the next 12 months.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

We currently work with agents throughout the UK and cover approximately 70% of England which we are progressively growing to 100% coverage. We are also expanding into Wales and have plans to master franchise to Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland in the future.

In the last 9 months we have taken on numerous new properties taking our management portfolio to 460 properties.

We raised over £230k last year as the first part of our crowdfunding campaign. This is our second and final crowdfunding campaign where we aim to raise in excess of £125,000 to increase our reserves and be used for investment into the increased trade awareness through marketing required to optimise the value of the business.

We now have 1705 user accounts using the website.

The business turnover for January and February 2016 has been £54k*.

### Monetisation strategy

Lettingsupermarket.com’s USP is that we are an online letting agent agency with a countrywide infrastructure of associate agents who visit the property, take photographs, conduct viewings and also complete inventory, check in, interim inspections and finally, check out.

Our agents are all fully qualified Inventory Clerks and each one is assigned a particular property. That particular agent then looks after that property from the initial property visit right through to the end of the tenancy. This is very appealing to landlords who have, previously, been used to agents sending in any member of staff, many of whom have never seen the property before and may not even know where the light switches are located. They are our “feet on the ground” in a particular area and are there to let in contractors when the property is unoccupied, deliver any required notices and see that the needs of both landlord and tenant are met. This USP gives us the opportunity to work with landlords who are not self-managing.

A critical point is that we offer the lowest prices for full property management and let only in the UK, directly as a result of separating lettings management functions from non -office based functions and embracing technology wherever possible. We are almost paperless, are able to operate from inexpensive offices and carry minimal staff as our agents, are all self-employed. Our agents are aware of the advantages we have in the marketplace and we have no difficulty in securing new agents in areas where we have properties available.

As we have, to date, only advertised on one property forum site, our growth has been exceptional and our agents see the potential for their own business growth. We are also in the process of amending our Terms and Conditions with our agents to ensure that on property letting packages they will work exclusively with us

### Use of proceeds

We have tried various marketing in the past and Property118.com continue to provide the vast majority of our new business referrals.

We will be looking to increase our marketing through a PR company to raise awareness of lettingsupermarket.com and increasing our google adwords campaign using banner re-marketing.

We will be attending trade shows over the coming 18 months which will allow us to increase the personal nature of our service by enabling landlords to meet some of the staff who they communicate with on a daily basis.

We will further be using the funds for cash flow to compensate for the seasonal fluctuations in the letting market.

We also will be updating the visual appearance of the website and adding automation to improve the service and efficiency of our management process.

The Company has an outstanding loan of £6,500 from startup Britain. The proceeds of investment will not be used to repay this loan.

Investments of £25,000 or more will qualify for property management free of charge, whilst these shares are held, for up to 10 properties.

## Market

![](https://seedrs.imgix.net/uploads/startup/section_image/image/7779/a5bx33l6vwv9cr7tjgsclykzsnjqf4u/LetSupMarketLogoLR.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C598%2C221&w=600&fit=clip&s=a0a4306d5094dad4c6e46876dd021420)

### Target market

Landlords with property in the private rented sector. Typically aged 35+ most typically aged 45-65 and have used/using property as a retirement fund. We are also targeting accidental landlords who are forced to rent due to the current state of the housing market.

### Characteristics of target market

• 2m households have been added to the private rented sector since 2001.

• Forecast show that there will be 5m households in the private rented sector by 2016.

• Buy to Let lending has increased by 34% last year alone.

It is clear from the increased number of online letting and estate agents in recent years that there is a definite consumer trend moving towards the more cost effective online side of the industry. However, this has so far been using a very basic service, often with management taking place via the use of an emergency breakdown service, without viewings and due diligence.

The primary source of competition to Lettingsupermarket.com are high street agencies who however a full service management package.

Lettingsupermarket.com provide a full property management service, much the same as provided by agents on the high street, but on a national scale with the added bonus of a much lower management fee.

### Marketing strategy

Having experimented with various marketing campaigns over the past 3 years we will be continuing with our promotion through property118.com which is providing us with an excellent conversion rate and due to the partnership in place we are the only agents able to advertise on one of the largest landlord forums in the UK.

We further plan to compliment our marketing through property118 by continuing our google AdWords campaign and increasing this with added re-marketing through banner advertising.

We are already actively receiving word of mouth promotion from many of our clients and plan to fully implement a referral scheme with a financial incentive for both parties shortly which will increase word of mouth promotion.

Following the recent valuations of our competition including easyproperty, emoov, estates direct and rentify where valuations vary from £20 to £60 million and following the recent purchase of an online agency by Connells which we believe to be the first acquisition of many by larger corporations to reduce the threat of the online market developing a significant market share we will be employing the services of a PR company to increase our market exposure through various print and online articles.

We also will be attending various trade shows throughout the country to allow us to increase market awareness of the Lettingsupermarket.com brand name and recruit large portfolio landlords.

We have recently gone into partnership with an investment firm which is the first of many firms we are in talks with to enable them to provide a full service to landlords from purchase, to management, to sale.

### Competition strategy

Our services do not include any hidden costs and our service is comparable to the high street something which many other online agents are unable to provide due to our extensive and qualified agent network.

Also due to the departmentalisation of our staff whereby we are able to split the specific roles required throughout the letting process we have managed to make our systems more efficient and plan to increase that efficiency through the automation of various parts of the maintenance process.
