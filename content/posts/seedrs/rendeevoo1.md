## Idea

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/771/1hl92p3z3y1vqw9hjha3pnmbjjwcec0/COVER_PHOTO.jpg?w=600&fit=clip&s=961fd3af3dc0e770f8217f81e1491b21)

### Introduction

rendeevoo is an iOS dating app that brings Londoners together in real life, and with just a few taps. We present a safe and convenient choice with authentic users and hand-picked places. Because we focus on real life, there is no browsing or chat features in our service.

You must be a 21+ Londoner with an active social profile to get in. We make sure about that with our very own Facebook ‘investigation’ algorithm. If you are social enough, your profile is automatically created using your top five pictures and some basic info.

The app is free to get and use, but to book a rendeevoo you need to pre-order your first cocktail which will wait for you at the bar. It costs £7 and we make our money by charging commission on every booking.

Our bars are all well-known for their exceptional quality, speak-easy atmosphere, and of course their tasty cocktails. We operate in tight capacities in order to maintain high levels of quality, which means we can serve limited number of rendeevoos every week.

### Intended impact

Our beta is scheduled to go live on the 22nd of March, and we plan to have 1,000 active testers and five bars.

Our vision is to bridge the gap between online and real-life flirting.

We want our customers to go out and flirt face to face. We aim to be a brand that people can trust, and we intend to deliver results instead of just providing access to a community or a marketplace.

We think that flirt is an experience best enjoyed with all five senses on alert, and we will advocate that belief while criticizing the effectiveness of online dating.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

• Our prototype is ready and available to download upon request. <br>• We have presented rendeevoo to Vlerick Business School four times, and received extremely valuable feedback from both the students and the faculty. <br>• We have pipelined the production of our first commercial, due to be published on the 1st of March. <br>• We have 400+ Facebook fans, 300+ twitter followers, and a klout score of 47. <br>• We have been mentioned as one of the apps for 2014 in the largest Belgian newspaper, on January the 4th. <br>• We have been interviewed by Asta Petkunaite from Dreamstake Academy, and we should be mentioned in their blog on the last week of February.

### Monetisation strategy

We charge a commission to our participating bars every time a Rendeevoo is booked in their premises. This is a fixed rate not related with referral volumes.

This is our only revenue stream for now, with the plan to add taxi rides as soon as our MVP fits the market.

There is also the intent to generate revenue through sponsors operating in neighbouring industries such as alcoholic brands, condoms, and fashion retailers.

Of course, we have also planned our geographical expansion to major European cities as well as New York.

### Use of proceeds

With our go-to-market costs already covered, this seed capital will be used to grow the initial business in London and make us ready for further investment.

We have a £13K budget for code tweaks, while the rest £12K will be spent in building up our brand.

Our plan is to penetrate London from the roots. We don’t advertise through paid mediums, and we don’t sell any of our users’ data to third parties.

We have laid the foundations for expanding in four European cities as soon as our MVP is in perfect shape.

Our medium-term goal is to raise £200K angel investment in early 2015, and expand aggressively on a global scale including New York.

## Market

### Target market

We target socially active Londoners, aged between 21 and 55, working and/or living within zones 1-3, owners of iOS phones, and with an active Facebook account.

### Characteristics of target market

Upper class citizens with £50k income or more, up to date with consumer technologies, and with well-developed social skills.

Most of these individuals are skeptic towards online dating, mostly because they can’t find the value in it. They are used to connect with new people through traditional channels in real life.

Since they view online dating as a last resort, they rarely consider it because their need to connect is often satisfied.

In spite of that, knowing that a safe, private, and convenient tool is out there, they would most likely get it and have it as a good alternative.

### Marketing strategy

We feel we are a superior brand with a provocative and witty character, and this is how we will enter the market. We will take advantage of our network of bars to attract our initial users, and kick-off our grassroots strategy.

Guided by a no-ad policy, we aim to be generating quality content, distribute it to a network of influential accounts, and gain exposure through them. Such accounts vary from fashion bloggers to bar associations and they will be fed with relevant content for them (or even sometimes directly tailored content).

We will also publish flirt-responsibly.com as our blog in the beginning of March. The content structure has already been defined, and it’s just the creation/curation that has been left.

In the real world we are targeting expat communities and postgrad students through event organisers. We also targeting beauty salons, hairdressers &amp; barbers, and retail shops in an attempt to use their personnel as our brand ambassadors.

Our intention is to maintain a low-profile and avoid ‘loud’ messages. The ecosystem we belong to is socially vibrant and can make a brand like ours known to the mass market.

### Competition strategy

Currently we know that our direct competitors have a subscription-based model and they compete on who has the best network-effects. The biggest player is Tinder, but there is also badoo and match. com with high mobile usage levels.

We are aware about a handful of promising apps that are less than 1 year old and show good results already. Pure and Carrot dating are the two most successful.

In London, lovestruck.com enjoys a good presence and has similar users with our target audience. Tablecrowd.com is the most promising new entrant. Both have different models than us.

We anticipate the emergence of competition in our business from new apps, with the same business model as ours. We will defend our position by securing the best bars in town and of course through our solid marketing efforts.
