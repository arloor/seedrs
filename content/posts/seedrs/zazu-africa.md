## Idea

### Introduction

Zazu is an end-to-end e-commerce and logistics platform that allows retailers and food processors to trade directly with farmers without sacrificing quality or efficiency.

Our objective is to aggregate farmers to trade with large retailers in their own countries by organising and coordinating logistics.

Zazu aims to manage the entire logistics chain. From field to warehouse. We expect that this will mean that we can deliver significant savings to the buyer and allow farmers to increase profits.

Zazu's lightweight, SMS-powered marketplace means retailers will be able to source large orders from previously unreachable rural farming communities and be confident of quality, quantity and delivery.

Zazu leverages technology to improve the lives of farmers.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only for existing shareholders, minimum details are being provided.

More information on Zazu is available on the company's website. Please note, this information has not been verified or approved by Seedrs.
