## Idea

### Introduction

ExpoCart is a marketplace that helps exhibitors to easily hire and purchase everything they need for their exhibition stands through a network of the UK’s leading exhibition suppliers. Exhibitors can choose from furniture, audio visual, printed displays, flooring, props and more which is all delivered directly to their stand. <br> <br>We’re a small (but energetic!) team of individuals who have huge ambitions to revolutionise the way businesses organise their exhibition stands by enabling them to order everything in one place for any major venue in the UK. <br> <br>As this is a pre-emption campaign for a £750k investment by Local Globe, open only for existing shareholders, minimum details are being provided. More information on Expocart can be found on the company's website or by downloading the supplementary documents. Please note, this information has not been verified or approved by Seedrs.

Please note that the Local Globe investment is for preference shares which enjoy 1x non-participating preferential return on exit or liquidation. Investments in this campaign will be for Ordinary shares, which are eligible for EIS tax relief.
