## Idea

### Introduction

This campaign is to allow investors the ability to exercise their pre-emption rights on a £70k investment that Race Space is raising offline. The investment is structured as a convertible, the terms of which are set out below. As this is a pre-emption campaign open only for existing shareholders, minimum details are being provided. More information on Race Space can be found on the company's website or by requesting access to the pitch deck. Please note, this information has not been verified or approved by Seedrs.

Please note that the company has a director loan of £150k. The funds raised will not be used to re-pay this loan.
