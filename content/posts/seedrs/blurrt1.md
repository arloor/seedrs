## Idea

### Proposition

There are numerous challenges for anyone seeking to make sense of social data: to collect what is relevant; filter out the noise; conduct an analysis of the data; find out what influencers are saying or simply pick out the most re-tweeted picture of a celeb. Blurrt enables all this to happen - from the serious to the trivial.

Blurrt is a social media analytics platform which allows customers to understand social conversations, through: <br>- Curation of data: collecting, filtering, analysing and displaying social data; <br>- Making overall sense of audience reaction; <br>- Identifying hotspots in the conversation and key contributors / influencers; <br>- Showcasing interesting content; &amp; <br>- An easy to use platform operating in real time.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only for existing shareholders, minimum details are being provided. More information on Blurrt is available on the company's website. Please note, this information has not been verified or approved by Seedrs.

### Share Details

The new round of investment has been led by Finance Wales. Finance Wales has been offered Preferred Ordinary Shares which carry the following rights:

A preferential dividend to receive a proportion of the company's net profits each year (starting at 10% in December 2017 and rising to 20% from December 2022 onwards).

On a distribution of proceeds on liquidation or sale/exit: <br>The Preferred Ordinary Shareholders first receive a preferred return of 1x their subscription price and any unpaid dividends. <br>Ordinary Shareholders then have the right to receive payment in respect of their original subscription price for the Ordinary Shares and any unpaid dividends. <br>Any remaining capital will then be distributed pro rata amongst all shareholders.

Investors via Seedrs are being offered Ordinary Shares, so they can take advantage of EIS relief if applicable.
