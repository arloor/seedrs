## Idea

This is a pre-emption campaign for Jump In who have raised a further £647,664.21 of funds. As an existing shareholder in Jump In, you have the right to exercise your pre-emption rights in order to maintain your current percentage ownership in the business. If you would like to exercise your pre-emption rights, simply click the invest button above and follow the instructions.

Please note that the company may raise a second funding round shortly after this one, where the price per share and total share issue will be higher than this round, as well as being eligible for EIS relief. Any second round is not confirmed and this round (and pre-emption round) are not dependant on the second funding round taking place. If Seedrs investors do not in aggregate subscribe for their total proportionate entitlement in this round, then due to a lack of demand it is unlikely that a pre-emption campaign on the Seedrs platform will be launched on the second round, should it take place.

Finally, please note that the new investor in this round has a liquidation preference such that they will receive the first £950,000 of any surplus assets, after which assets will be distributed to the remaining shareholders.
