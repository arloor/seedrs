## Idea

### Introduction

This is a pre-emption round as we have received direct invest totalling c.£1.85m. Our business model remains the same - solely focussed on BTL and a marketplace Model (including Retail P2P). We will continue to stay focussed as we see a huge opportunity in the £240bn BTL Mortgage.

2018 was a major growth year for Landbay on Multiple metrics. Monthly lending from Jan 18 to Jan 19 grew by c 3x and annual revenue in 2018 was more than 4 x 2017*. In addition we were awarded BTL let of the Year in November 2018.

We still haven't experienced any defaults.
