## Idea

### Preemption

This in the second instalment in a three part investment agreed with a lead investor. The investment is being offered to the current investors who have preemption rights on the same terms as the lead investor.

Please note, the company is currently negotiating a Â£350,000 loan from a current shareholder, with an interest rate accruing at 4% for the first 5 years and 6% thereafter. This loan is to be repaid the earlier of an IPO, a founder sale, or a share sale.
