## Idea

### Introduction

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/14061/5bvg5zf0r4bggkoljdb4x4fxflu2ebs/Screen_Shot_2018-03-05_at_11.36.01.png?rect=0%2C0%2C1309%2C874&w=600&fit=clip&s=a09a2d1af620e0330baf29e17c6da763)

Started just under two years ago by Rupert Rixon at 21 years old (in a shed), Perspective Pictures is a video production company now based in North London, focused on creating engaging, creative, digital-first video content.

In the past 18 months we’ve grown incredibly quickly, working on advertisements, event videos, documentaries, short films, and commercial projects for clients including Rolls Royce, The RAF, UFC, Brewdog, HSBC, and Sony across Europe, North America, South Asia, and North Africa.

### Intended impact

In 2019 its thought that over 80% of all online traffic will be video. Almost 5 billion videos are watched on YouTube every day, and yet it still seems, in our opinion, that the majority of brands are left behind. Why?

We believe that producing video content for online isn’t the same as TV - pure and simple. In our experience, there is already a huge number of video production companies out there who produce fantastic TV ads/programs, and brands are used to it, but this content simply doesn’t translate properly to online.

If you want to reach an audience online, particularly a younger one, we think you need to tailor the content for that medium. In our view, the video often needs to be subtitled, fitted to different aspect ratios, grab people within the first 5 seconds, and most importantly feel authentic.

That’s where we come in - forget about traditional media, we create branded content exclusively for digital.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

We've worked with an array of fantastic companies, including:

- In Year One (May 16-17) we had turnover of over £46,000 without any investment.

- In Year Two to date (May 17 - Mar 18), we have already billed over £110,000 worth of business.

- January 2018 had revenue of £9,334, compared to just £375 revenue in January 2017.

- We’ve had to change office multiple times in under two years on account of our growth.

- We’ve completed well over 100 projects in under two years, for clients including Rolls Royce, Google, HSBC, Island Records, SEGRO, and the RAF.

### Monetisation strategy

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/14065/hxz5x8er4g1bexq59d4jywyyn7bgatl/Screen_Shot_2018-03-05_at_11.43.10.png?rect=0%2C6%2C1312%2C875&w=600&fit=clip&s=616f6a5f5f6e2c28af83bc0014bbaf6e)

Our revenue model is relatively straightforward. The client gives us a brief or a problem to solve, we put forward a treatment. If approved, they pay us 50% deposit upfront, and then we invoice the additional 50% once the project is completed.

### Use of proceeds

Improving our Product: 8.5%.

We'll be paying for a series of workshops for our creative team with high-level filmmakers to ensure what we’re producing is absolutely top notch.

Sales / Marketing: 60%.

What we will be spending the majority of this investment on is bringing new business through the door. SEO, Adwords, an effective business development agency, hiring an experienced sales manager, improving our website/branding, and hiring a keen business development executive.

Increasing capacity: 12.5%.

We expect more work coming through the door, so we want to be sure we can handle it. We want to hire a new senior filmmaker to join the team, as well as build a new high spec computer for the office to reduce render times, and speed up our editing workflow.

The remaining funds will be used to cover SEEDRS and accounting fees as well as hold some funds for contingency.

Please note that the Company has a finance lease on camera equipment to the value of £21,997 + VAT. The proceeds of this raise will not be used to make payments on the lease (£723.38 per month) - the lease will be repaid out of operating profit.

## Market

### Target market

The market for digital video content is vast. From speaking with our clients, it seems that brands are starting to realise the value of social media and the importance of video to engage their customers. We want to work with medium to large companies and produce creative online advertisements for digital campaigns.

Another target market is digital agencies. There are over 25,000 agencies in the UK alone and many of them can often not afford to have their own video production teams in-house. We want to build close relationships with agencies to become their go-to video production company.

### Characteristics of target market

Our target market is very broad. It comprises of brands, start-ups, and agencies. Digital marketing is becoming more accessible and important, with demand for video increasing rapidly.

The major social media networks are prioritizing video content. There are billions of video views on Facebook every day. This means that it's important for brands to provide video for their customers.

Currently, we believe that there is a lack of strategic approach from brands, who in our experience are turning to agencies or social media teams to come up with content ideas. We intend to use our specialism in digital video to stand out and offer them advice.

Our target market will also be concerned with budget and reliability. We have worked hard to gain the trust of and retain our clients.

### Marketing strategy

Our marketing strategy relies on reaching key stakeholders through a variety of routes. We want to increase our reach and existing network by:

- Expanding our sales team - Hiring an experienced sales manager and a keen business development executive. We would also like to work with a Business Development agency to set up meetings with our sales team.

- Improve SEO and increase AdWords spend - We want to build on this success by expanding our online presence and experimenting with providing for innovative formats, such as 360° video and live streams.

- Website/Branding improvement - To this point, all our website development has been done in-house. We are enthusiastic to build more professional branding materials.

### Competition strategy

With such large demand, there are unsurprisingly lots of video production companies.

However, to the best of our knowledge, very few video production companies take a platform-first approach to digital media. With our experience in creating content for younger audiences and social media success, we are looking to reverse-engineer the video production process - building content around each social media platforms’ requirements. For example, we intend to shoot more vertical videos, add more graphics and produce influencer content.

We've also seen that agencies may shop around for different video production teams, due in part to a long turnaround time for quotes. We aim to cultivate close relationships, and want to be able to deliver a quote in less than 15 minutes and - if requested - a pitch deck within 48 hours.
