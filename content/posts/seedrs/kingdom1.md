# [KINGDOM](https://www.seedrs.com/kingdom1)

## Idea

### Introduction

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/10167/cgy32y1wiue5vri1krempai6nc0908g/Kingdom_1.png?rect=28%2C40%2C1362%2C801&w=600&fit=clip&s=39f491168a2da5739223883fcf473973)

A NATURAL SPACE TO UNPLUG, UNWIND &amp; RELAX WITH FAMILY &amp; FRIENDS OVER A MEAL, A DRINK OR A BIKE RIDE AROUND THE 13 ACRE WOODLAND.

Helping the young to grow up and the grown-ups to stay young.

In our always-on, fast-paced, and digital culture, moments of quality are more important than ever. Many of us are looking for ways to connect back to the things that truly matter in life for ourselves and for our kids.

Our answer is KINGDOM. A unique leisure, community, and dining space for family and friends to put the world on hold for a while. To relax, revitalise, and re-invigorate mind, body, and soul. A place to embrace nature and have an adventure.

We're just starting and we hope to create a number of unique spaces across the country that offer a range of experiences from skiing to surfing or climbing. But we're starting where our passion lies: with cycling.

### Intended impact

THE OPPORTUNITY

As we embark on the next stage of the Kingdom journey, we are offering investors the chance to own a slice of the adventure.

Cycling is a growing market, with 1 in 10 adults in the UK cycling at least once a month. The UK currently represents 18% of the EU bike market (2014, by units sold). Kingdom, Penshurst, aims to harness that market by helping people switch-off from the daily grind and re-connect to nature and to one another. <br>Our unique site is nestled in the West Kent countryside, with beautiful views of the surrounding hills and woodland. You could be in the middle of nowhere, yet just 30 miles south of London and just 7 miles from the busy commuter towns of Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge. It is in this location that we wish to offer safe 'adventures' themed around cycling, all within an enjoyable natural environment. We aim to build a community based on the unique shared experiences of our customers.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

What we've already achieved in the past 12 months:

### Monetisation strategy

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/10168/dz83rrjtsqi9uhibstu4lldzi48nrvp/Kingdom_5.png?rect=0%2C0%2C1439%2C951&w=600&fit=clip&s=9fe0cb4a6d1f3208675bd6baaf760fd8)

Kingdom intends to deploy both B2C and B2B strategies to maximise revenue. We intend to generate income by combining a number of complimentary revenue streams: <br>1) sport and leisure event programming for all ages and abilities. <br>2) retail/hire/service of cycle sport and leisure products. <br>3) hospitality events (private, corporate &amp; community). <br>4) accommodation (seasonal glamping and event related overnight stays). <br>5) Food &amp; Beverage (cafe, event space hires, weddings, parties, corporates). <br>6) Fitness &amp; Wellbeing programme. <br>7) Membership scheme (corporate, club, teams, families, individuals).

Our operational team will oversee and manage the venue and, in partnership with others, we aim to attract an estimated 100,000 visitors per annum with significant capacity for growth as the venue develops.

(Principal target partners include on site concessions, national governing bodies, corporate partners and cycling clubs. For example, there are 75 British Cycling registered clubs within a 20 mile radius and 279 clubs within a 30 mile radius).

### Use of proceeds

We wish to raise funds to bring the next stage of the Kingdom journey to life. We have ambitious plans to create a number of unique spaces across the country but we are only at the starting line and we are starting where our passion lies: with cycling.

Proceeds of funds:

We need to lay 1.1-mile or tarmac around our road race circuit (costed at £240,000). <br>We need to complete the installation of services to Kingdom Clubhouse - and we want to do so in a sustainable manner (costed at £60,000). <br>We want to introduce glamping accommodation (costed at £5,000). <br>We have to improve the groundworks to the site - which is important as it allows you to reach us safely. This consists of things such as entrance road, carpark surface, and improved drainage (costed at £55,000).

Please note that there is an outstanding loan of £1,825,000 from the original purchase of the land. The loan has no interest attached and the repayment is fixed at the higher of £50,000 per annum or 10% of revenue, payable quarterly.

### Marketing strategy

Our marketing plan (high level outline):

Strategy: <br>The marketing plan and communication strategy will adopt a proactive approach producing consistent and direct communications, creating awareness, interest, and motivating people to visit Kingdom. <br>All activity will be tailored to the relevant target audience, promoting and positioning Kingdom’s offering within the different target groups.

Objectives: <br>- Increase / maximise awareness of Kingdom within key target markets for both and regional / national event programmes. <br>- Inform and educate existing and new customers within UK, south east England and Kent/Sussex generating and increasing reasons to visit the park. <br>- Develop and enhance communication from Kingdom both internally and externally.

### Competition strategy

Current competitors (name and distance away from Kingdom): <br>- Bedgebury Forest distance 18 miles, <br>- Cyclopark distance 30 miles, <br>- Betteshangar distance 71 miles, <br> All offer a mix of cycling/leisure facilities however Bedgebury only offers mountain biking, has limited indoor event space and no on site accommodation, Cyclopark is located close to an 8 lane motorway with significant background noise and a limited 'experience style offer'. Betteshangar is a considerable distance away on the east Kent coast and we believe currently offers limited event space, low level catering, and no accommodation.

Kingdom aims to provide visitors a place for safe adventures and a chance to escape and explore, and time for personal growth providing a unique sport and leisure destination in a stunning woodland setting for the growing 'experience' based economy. Combining great facilities in a fantastic location sets Kingdom apart from its competitors.

Kingdom intends, in its first phase, to provide a highly technical cycle circuit, a striking club house with cafe, bar and event space set deep in the Kent countryside yet close to its affluent customer base (Population 3,772,445 within 45-minute drive time catchment). Kingdom will provide on-site retail (sales, service, and hire) in partnership with Wyndymilla our onsite concession who will also provide group and individual coaching. Kingdom aims to offer great food in partnership with Basil our on-site concession for visitors, parties, weddings and corporate hire. Kingdom plans to work with British Cycling the national governing body of cycling to develop a programme of events (including training and coaching). Our own Kingdom Cycle Club will help identify future talent and potential podium winners. <br>The Kingdom team, using its experience in sports development / operations, hospitality, and event management will create a holistic experience for its customers to refresh, recharge, and reconnect with the natural environment whilst participating in sport &amp; leisure.
