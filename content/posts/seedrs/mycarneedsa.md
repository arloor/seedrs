## Idea

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/16135/atb21fns2xoqz2n0n9nretr6svilgdo/Intro_image.png?rect=0%2C60%2C600%2C491&w=600&fit=clip&s=2c39dd1a96912f63e29cc5ff7d4d2c51)

### Intended impact

MyCarNeedsA.com was started to meet the needs of two separate sets of customers: <br> <br>Car owners: Routine car maintenance is a dull, evil necessity. Our experience suggests that most car owners don’t know the ‘fair’ price of most jobs, awareness of garages in the area is often low, there’s a level of mistrust of the trade, and obtaining quotes to allow for shopping around can be difficult and time-consuming. <br>With minimum effort, and at no cost, MyCarNeedsA.com saves the car owner time, money, hassle, and worry. <br> <br>Service providers (independent garages, franchised dealers and chains): Our experience in the market suggests that these businesses find it difficult to recruit new customers. Even those with a sound core of loyal business can often lack marketing resources to expand their base, or to attract the most profitable work in a way that suits their workflow schedules. For a monthly subscription, MyCarNeedsA.com can fulfil that marketing function and delivers quote requests that can be selected by Service Providers to suit their own business needs.

### Monetisation strategy

Service is free to car owners. <br> <br>Service Providers pay a monthly fee to join the network and be able to quote for jobs. License fees range from £10-120 per site, dependent on the volume of work available, plus £2.50 fee for every accepted quote. Our price structure is built around a strategy of lower trial period pricing to encourage quality service provider signup, with subscription rates rising as volume of business to each provider rises. <br> <br>Customer satisfaction and internal marketing are driving a rapid increase in repeat use from existing car owners, thus: <br>- stimulating overall volume of business delivered to service providers - thus increasing revenues. <br>- dramatically reducing acquisition costs, from &gt; £10 per new user initially to less than 10p per repeat job - thus increasing profitability. <br> <br>As the database grows further, we expect that additional revenue streams will become available through the provision of additional services to car owners such as extended warranties, accident management schemes, insurance and used car search.

### Use of proceeds

In securing new investment, the company will accelerate the growth of new customers and the future opportunity provided by repeat jobs in the seeded database.

The new investment will provide marketing budget to acquire new car owners, on a linear basis per month, using historical performance and CPA’s per marketing channel. In doing so, the subsequent increase of the database can be projected and utilised to forecast future jobs and network growth.

As Service Provider revenues are linked to the volume of jobs, revenues should also increase accordingly. Investment will also be used to ensure the company has adequate resource to manage the growing network and maximise revenues accordingly.

With increasing repeat jobs at a significantly lower cost per acquisition, the opportunity for further profitability grows exponentially.

Having grown the active database, revenues and profitability, the company will position itself to develop trade-sale opportunities within the automotive, aggregator and publishing sectors.
