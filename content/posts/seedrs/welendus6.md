## Idea

### Introduction

We believe that short-term borrowers in the UK are underserved and do not get a good and fair service from lenders, whether it’s a payday loan, a short-term loan or an unarranged banking overdraft. Compellingly short term borrowing is at an all time high. This, alongside the bad practice in the sector and widespread customer mistreatment, has led to a huge need for change.

Welendus is re-defining the short-term credit market by introducing a value adding and competitive peer-to-peer short-term lending product. With full FCA authorisation in hand, our aim is to help people in short-term financial needs borrow directly from other people at a cheaper rate with no hidden costs or charges. Being a peer-to-peer lender, Welendus is helping financial inclusion while funnelling the short-term lending returns back to the society.

Our mission is to offer better, ethical, more flexible and more affordable short-term loans for borrowers through a clear, bespoke, and easy to use platform. For lenders, Welendus offers returns with the short-term investment flexibility and the benefit of a provision fund cover.

### Intended impact

The short-term credit market is let down by many existing players. Welendus is disrupting this let down market by offering short-term borrowers affordable, ethical and competitive short-term loans. Welendus will operate as a peer-to-peer lender, meaning borrowers will be borrowing directly from other individuals.

Summary of features for borrowers: <br>* Lower cost short-term loan APR starting from 205%, in comparison with up to 1,294% from current payday lenders. <br>* No hidden costs or charges and no penalty fees. <br>* Transparent, effective and friendly service. <br>* No banking fees. <br>* No early repayment fees.

For investors, Welendus enables them to invest in short-term loans, offering higher returns with the short-term investment flexibility and the benefit of a Provision Fund. We believe this is offering is unmatched in the market.

Using Welendus, investors are able to choose their own return from 5% to 15% p.a. Investors can take advantage of the AutoMatch™ feature which automatically matches corresponding borrowers based on the investors' risk preference. This is in addition to the fully automated Autodiversify™ feature, which can efficiently manage investors’ investment portfolio. Plus, Welendus operates a Provision Fund which aims to reimburse the investor if the borrower defaults.

### Characteristics of target market

### Marketing strategy

We have released Welendus beta soft-launch with our mobile adaptive web platform in Q4 2017. This allowed testing and confirmation that the systems, controls and marketing channels were effective and staged to attract exponential growth.

We are looking to end the soft-launch very soon and will increase our marketing budget. We are also planning to release our native iOS and Android apps. During the full launch we plan to release other very exciting new products that we believe will accelerate our customer acquisition and will lower our customer acquisition cost.

Our routes to market are as follow: <br>* Targeted marketing through paid ads (including search engine, social media and display). <br>* Promotional Partnerships. <br>* Innovative above the line customer acquisition product. <br>* Network effects. <br>* Virality. <br>* SEO- organic. <br>* Price comparison.

### Competition strategy

At Welendus we are all about technology &amp; efficiency, creativity and innovation. We are using some technologies in the background which will allow us to verify customers, accurately calculate the risks as well as offer a fully automated fast lending service to borrowers.

With our highly scalable business model we are looking to rapidly reach a market leading position in the UK which will follow with international expansion.

Welendus aims to bring innovative products to the peer-to-peer and the short-term credit markets. We believe that through our all new fully automated platform together with our innovative marketing approach, Welendus will have a head start not only with technology but also with customer acquisition and market share.

Additionally, we are dedicated to adopting the highest standards and best practicesWith the ever-increasing tougher regulations, we believe the long and difficult regulatory processes will create another strong barrier to entry following Welendus launch.
