## Idea

### Introduction

Further to our recent update, we are now raising funds for our 2019 working capital requirement. Full details of requirements and progress can be found in the last update notice, also attached to this campaign. There are 8,907 shares being offered to current investors in this private round at a 20% valuation increase based on the successes of this year. Seedrs has preemption rights so you can at least be allocated shares according to you previous holding percentage. Pre-emption rights apply until Friday November 2, and new shareholders may be accepted if the round is not filled.

### Intended impact

Working capital for potential new multiple retailer listing spring 19. <br>Significant expansion into EU in spring 19 with a focus on Germany and Belgium. <br>Food service sales in the UK in early 19. <br>Store extension in Netherlands. <br>Exploration of USA production facilities (for 2020 expansion). <br>Finalise development of new product lines. <br>Implementation of fully scalable internal systems to integrate production, purchasing, accounting and projections into one automated platform.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

Sales to August have beaten entire 2017/18 revenues. <br>Winner of the Healthy Food Guide’s Best of Health Awards 2018 (Snacks/Frozen Treats category). <br>Winner of 2 Nourish Awards (Best Dairy Free Ice Cream and People’s Choice Awards). <br>Kosher Parve certification completed. <br>Food service product developed, produced and out with Green Seed sales teams. <br>Finished stock and ingredients grown from £50k in April 2018 to £114k as of Sept 1st, 2018. <br>Rotations and promo performance have been good in Jumbo; performance 'much higher than expected' (quote from buyer Oct 18). <br>Ocado performance up over 400% YTD over the same period last year. <br>German sales teams engaged for potential Spring 19 launch - positive sample tastings have resulted in one major retailer meeting so far, and requests for Dec-Feb follow up from 4 others; two more are expected to request samples. <br>Belgian sales team contracted October 18. Sales push started for spring 19 launch.

### Monetisation strategy

Expansion of EU and UK distribution. <br>Launch of new food service product. <br>Independent distribution channels. <br>Finalised development and launch of new product ranges.

### Use of proceeds

Increase of stock and materials to avoid 'just in time delivery' and allow larger finished good volumes (larger buffer stock) to be stored abroad. <br>Expanded 2019 marketing budget for new launches in the UK and for new EU territories. <br>Implement new internal integrated systems. <br>Pursue further markets for later in 2019 (EU) and 2020 (targets will be USA, AU, Middle East).
