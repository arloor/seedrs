# [The Chequers](https://www.seedrs.com/the-chequers2)

## Idea

### Introduction

We are offering the opportunity to be part of a project that we believe will return the Chequers to its position as a 'go to' pub. One that delivers native rare breed and other produce together with quality ales, ciders and distinct wines straight to the heart of the local community.

We aim to always know where and who our food comes from. We source artisan supplies directly, offering value for money for our customers. Unlike a vast swathe of the pub catering market we aim to always guarantee our foods’ provenance and that it is ethically sourced.

The cross-pollination between the new pub and it’s sister pub The Albert, gives the new venture a huge advantage over other entrants. Rather than being a start-up business, it will be the replication of a proven business model,which we feel will considerably enhance its chances of success. Investors are encouraged to try out The Albert, taste rare breed product and see if they share our beliefs!

### Intended impact

It is our belief that our target market is increasingly discerning, recognising that we are oversupplied with mass produced, commercially processed and tasteless produce. When you taste our rare breed product you realise there is a significant difference in both quality and flavour. We believe that there is a gap in the market for a pub brand with rare breeds at the heart. We aim to fill that gap.

It is our vision with The Chequers to champion the ‘Best of British’ and increase awareness and enjoyment of rare breed produce through the high quality food and drink we provide. We aim for our menu to be a platform for fine food produce from independent suppliers and small holdings across the country.

We intend to only source the finest and freshest produce that each season has to offer and only purchase our ingredients from suppliers that are as passionate about food as we are. We expect that this will result in a menu of quality at competitive price points.

Our intention is for The Rare Breed Pub Company to showcase artisan beers and ciders from micro-breweries and our wine list to be carefully constructed to offer a range of varied wines that will complement the menu at affordable prices. We aim to also offer a very broad range of these wines by the glass. We aim to get drinks options that are not common in High street supermarkets.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

Heads of terms have been agreed with the vendor for the assignment of the lease.The lease runs to 15th July 2026. Upon taking occupancy we aim to approach the landlord with a view to extending the term. <br> <br>Our key operational personnel have extensive experience in the licensed trade, having redeveloped one of Esher’s most iconic buildings and turned it into a leading real ale pub and restaurant.

### Monetisation strategy

The company plans to exploit and expand the successful formula which has been developed and refined at The Albert Arms in Esher.

Offering high quality, responsibly sourced food with primarily British provenance will cater to a target market which has an established appetite for regular dining out.

The site of The Chequers matches the demographic profile of Esher and is close enough to enable key management to oversee the development and running of the business.

There are three key revenue streams that we have identified and are aiming towards. <br>• Diners (target 30% of takings at 63% gross margin). <br>• Drinkers (target 70% of takings at 63% gross margin). <br>• Overnight accommodation (target 65% occupancy).

In our experience these are conservative targets when compared to the Albert.*

### Use of proceeds

The funds will be applied to refurbishment of the building, including a reworking of the garden to recreate the vista over the South Downs. We intend for all five bedrooms to be refurbished to modern standards while retaining the character and charm of the pub and its setting. ///An initial marketing push will be needed as well as establishing the brand and awareness of The Chequers in the context of the local community and the Rare Breed concept and ethics. In short The Chequers will be refurbished, reinvented and reinvigorated.

## Market

### Target market

The demographic makeup of ward containing The Chequers is very similar to that of The Albert and we expect that they will have similar leisure behaviour and spending patterns. The population of the Esher area served by The Albert is 6,759. The population of the Ardingly and Balcombe Ward is 6,031. The urban professionals, associate professions and Managers and Directors that are our target market and make up the majority of eating and drinking clientele of the Esher pub make up 59.4% of the Ardingly and Balcombe Ward area compared to 68% of the Esher area. House price averages are similarily close with Esher averaging at £863k and the Ardingly and Slaughman at £796k. <br>We believe that urban professionals who enjoy their food and drink will pay a fair price for quality produce.We intend to engage with this target market through our marketing strategy that includes a cross section of social media engagement including the use of video as both an educational and advertising medium. We aim for this to be through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and of course on our website. The following video shows how we have used this to publicise The Albert <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="outside" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJoDrimQivA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJoDrimQivA</a>.

### Characteristics of target market

As mentioned in the target market section, the demographical makeup of The Chequers to The Albert are similar. We believe these similarities will equate to comparable leisure behaviour.

### Marketing strategy

We think our proposition is compelling and that we can replicate the success of The Albert in Esher. We believe that the demographics are right and unlike many ideas all investors and potential investors can see and taste our idea by going to The Albert- enjoy the experience, imagine it expanded and decide if you want to be a part of it!

Our marketing strategy aims to build loyalty with existing customers and attract new customers via word-of-mouth referrals, digital marketing, print and social media. Through effective use of marketing we feel that as this project moves from concept, to proof of concept, to an operational pub - then a brand can be built around that story. And through the creation of that brand, significant value can be added to the business. Our aim is that our name will become synonymous with sustainable, ethically sourced food which has provenance and is of outstanding quality and value served in a pub with a great atmosphere.

### Competition strategy

We intend to differentiate through a combination of brand, product, experience/service and technology. We believe we have an exciting proposition in that our food and drink offerings stand out from the competition enabling customers to clearly understand what they can expect from a trip to The Chequers.Through consistent use of social media as well as tradional promotional tools we will seek to reinforce our USP’s to our target market. Data capture is important to the business and will be encouraged at every touch point from booking to paying the bill.
