# [TAPPED Birch Water](https://www.seedrs.com/tapped)

## Idea

### Introduction

At TAPPED we make natural, healthy hydrating drinks from birch water, the sap which flows inside birch trees. Drinking birch sap is a centuries old Nordic tradition; every spring Nordic folk have enjoyed birch water as a rejuvenating tonic; it’s also been consumed for a range of health benefits. We’re making the natural wonder of birch water available to a wider audience.

Our range of 3 TAPPED birch water drinks can be found in over 250 UK stores including Boots, Wholefoods, Planet Organic, As Nature Intended, Selfridges, and online too via Ocado, Amazon and Abel &amp; Cole. TAPPED is also launching in 92 Sainsbury’s stores in May.

TAPPED is also available in over 50 stores in Europe, primarily in Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, plus available online in Germany and Spain.

Based in London, TAPPED was set up 2 years ago, by former innocent drinks colleagues Paul Lederer and Charlie Hoare.

### Intended impact

Birch water is birch sap, the liquid which flows inside birch trees carrying vitamins &amp; minerals which nourish the tree. Birch water has been harvested &amp; enjoyed for centuries every spring as a rejuvenating tonic. Increasing consumer interest and demand, coupled with advances in processing &amp; preservation techniques, has seen availability and consumption increase in recent years.

Tree waters tap into consumer trends for nutritious drinks which are natural, low calorie, healthy and tasty. Coconut Water has grown into a market worth approx. $1bn in North America and Europe, while tree and plant waters have been forecasted to reach $2bn by 2025.

Our mission is to inspire natural, healthy living by offering a range of drinks collected from nature itself. By developing tree waters we’re also encouraging people to embrace nature - but not just by getting more and more people to consume natural drinks from trees. In Finland, for example, forest owners are choosing to turn over areas of birch forest for sap collection. Some are also looking at how the bark, leaves etc can be used, hence encouraging new and alternate uses for trees rather than traditional logging.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

We launched TAPPED in April 2015, initially in 9 WholeFoodsMarket stores, and have increased distribution to over 250 UK stores including Boots, Planet Organic, As Nature Intended, Selfridges, and online too via Ocado, Amazon and Abel &amp; Cole. We are also launching TAPPED in 92 Sainsbury’s stores in May.

TAPPED is also available in over 50 stores in Europe, primarily in Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, plus available online in Germany and Spain.

Along the way TAPPED has enjoyed some great press coverage including: The Times, The Guardian, Telegraph, Financial Times, Metro, Vogue, Grazia, Shortlist and more…

We’ve picked up 9 business awards including Zenith International’s Drinkpreneur (2015) award whose jury included a panel of major retail buyers.

During this time we’ve sold over 200,000 cartons of TAPPED and built a business which roughly doubled in size (+87%) in the last year.*

All of these achievements have not gone unnoticed in the soft drinks industry: we are regularly invited to talk at national and international conferences.

*Based on unaudited management accounts.

### Monetisation strategy

We see opportunities to grow TAPPED's sales by increasing availability through new UK customer listings and through continued international expansion in selected markets, primarily in Europe. We’ve had trade enquiries from most international markets we might ever want to take TAPPED to, including the US, China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand...).

We also plan to increase our distribution and sales by expanding our product range with new flavours (we have the recipes) and new larger pack sizes, which should increase the usage occasions for birch water. Our supply chain and manufacturing is outsourced to a small network of carefully selected partners and as we expand, we believe that economies of scale will allow us to improve our margins.

### Use of proceeds

We have good reserves of stock and forward contracts in place for fresh sap from our suppliers from April 2017's sap harvest so this fundraise will primarily be used to invest further in sales and marketing activities.

We plan to increase consumer awareness of birch water and drive trial and consumption.

With this raise we intend to:

1. Invest further in supporting sales – more customer specific activity and sales resource to build our UK distribution.

2. Accelerate our marketing including hiring a marketing executive whose job it will be to generate press, get TAPPED featured at events, organise our sampling activity, manage social media, and manage brand ambassadors who will help deliver this.

3. Launch new products including at least one new flavour (we have several recipes to choose from) and a larger pack (e.g. 1Litre) as we have several retail customers who've expressed interest.

The company currently has an outstanding director's loan of £80,000 (interest free). Funds raised will not be used to repay the loan.

## Market

### Target market

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/11819/3zlh4xqrdlhb8x4sljhr254r73lfi97/Tansy.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1280%2C720&w=600&fit=clip&s=5ecf660b850f38d459c779e6e03895e9)

TAPPED is targeted at people who are interested in health &amp; food. Broadly our target consumer is 25-45 years old, predominantly female (but not solely), who can invest in their health through their food and lifestyle choices.

Typically this is young, urban, professionals who are busy working full time, that might have a family and are looking for interesting &amp; intriguing healthy refreshments. They are conscious of their consumption of sugars and sweeteners (and are likely to be trying to limit consumption of one or both).

They care about what they eat and drink and want products which enable them to stay healthy yet taste good at the same time.

Such consumers also tend to enjoy organic foods so we make sure we use organic birch water.

In the longer term, we expect the awareness and appeal of birch water to increase so the customer base should widen. We’ve seen this trend happen before with smoothies and more recently coconut water.

### Characteristics of target market

The UK soft drinks market is estimated to be worth approx. £14bn (2016), with 200 soft drinks bought every second. It is currently undergoing an important change. Consumers are moving away from sweet drinks due to health concerns around sugar (and artificial sweeteners) and developing an increasing preference for drinks which are more natural and less sweet.

No 1 brand Coca-Cola's sales declined last year. Meanwhile bottled water is in steady growth and looks set to replicate the trend we’ve seen in the US where volume sales of bottled water have overtaken those of carbonated soft drinks. We believe this means that retailers’ need for premium soft drinks which drive soft drinks category growth is especially pronounced.

The alternative waters/tree &amp; plant waters is worth $2.7bn billion, and forecast to double in size to reach $5.4 billion by 2020. Coconut water represented 86% of this in 2016, with other tree &amp; plant waters including birch water accounting for the remaining 14% of the market. The tree and plant waters market has been forecast to grow to be worth $2bn by 2025.

Consumers also appear to be seeking drinks which have some added functionality, ideally naturally derived. We’ve seen coconut water capitalise on this with drinks which are natural, low in sugar and provide health benefits.

Birch water similarly meets these needs, being natural, low in sugar, not sweet, refreshing, and having health benefits through naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.

### Marketing strategy

IN-STORE: Since day 1 when we launched in WholeFoodsMarket High St Kensington, turning a pillar into a birch tree, we’ve focused on in-store impact. We're building birch trees, bringing the nature of the birch forest to stores just as innocent smoothies used astroturf to bring nature to store, and Vita-Coco used deckchairs and T shirts to bring the Brazilian beach to store. We support this with regular in-store sampling activity, promotions to encourage trial purchase and point of sale materials. As we expand our business we intend to do more of this including retailer specific marketing campaigns.

SAMPLINGS: We believe people need to try birch water and we have undertaken over 300 in-store samplings. We also support events with drinks and sample at selected consumer shows (such as OM Yoga Show and Scandinavian Mid-Summer markets). This May we attended the Balance Festival which is one of the UK's largest celebrations of the thriving fitness scene and wellness movement.

YOGA BY TAPPED/TAPPED TRAINING <br>We also run our own events, working with up &amp; coming yoga teachers and personal trainers, plus retailers in the healthy food, fitness and clothing sectors (e.g. Sweaty Betty and lululemon).

SOCIAL MEDIA: We tell people what we’re up to, sharing information about the tree tapping process and traditions, including using short video clips from the birch forest. Birch water is intriguingly different, so we need to make sure TAPPED is interesting and can delight and engage its followers.

PRESS &amp; PR: We’ve generated some great press so far and plan to generate further coverage, especially when we launch new products. We also aim to use written press pieces to raise awareness of birch water, how we get it and its benefits.

### Competition strategy

The soft drinks market is highly competitive with lots of choice for the consumer and new sub-categories emerging.

In the tree water space there are over 10 brands in the UK market which, in our opinion, is exactly what a new category needs at the beginning; lots of brands competing, making noise, bringing new consumers into the category. We believe the 4 main brands to be: TAPPED, Treevitalise (birch), Sibberi (birch, maple), and DrinkMaple (maple).

Within the birch space we believe we have the best tasting products and have created the most distinct proposition, with a brand identity and packaging that helps explain what the drinks are and their Nordic roots. Although we have created a brand which could one day sell tree waters from different trees, we believe that right now we should focus on one tree – birch – and to do it well; to educate the consumer about the birch tree and its specific benefits. It’s too early to branch out* into other tree sources as it will only confuse the consumer with inconsistent messaging and imagery.

* pun intended

Our range of 3 products widens appeal. Our Pure Organic appeals to consumers who want the pure experience of organic birch water straight from the tree. Our 2 flavoured products extend the appeal to those who want a solid dose of flavour from a clean refreshing and hydrating drink, but who don’t want the sugar or calories or that cloying sensation on the teeth. We believe this makes our flavoured products somewhat unique in the UK market: we’ve struggled to find any other fully flavoured products which are made with natural ingredients and not with sugar and/or artificial sweeteners. We think there’s a real opportunity to develop this market further with more flavours, especially for the lunch/with food market, as well as general on the go consumption.
