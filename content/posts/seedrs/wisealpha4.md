## Idea

WiseAlpha Technologies is an innovative marketplace lending platform that gives members the opportunity to earn attractive returns by investing in secured corporate loans and bonds (via the issuance of its Notes).

Wisealpha is part of the growing Fintech and ‘DIY lending’ movement that is disrupting traditional asset management and finance markets by moving markets online and facilitating smaller investments thereby democratising financial markets. Through WiseAlpha we are aiming to innovate the large corporate debt investment market.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only to existing investors, limited information is being provided at this time.
