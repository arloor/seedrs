## Idea

### Impact

Stores are set to become hubs for more immersive &amp; personal brand experiences, and the Scoop Retail platform enables retailers to deliver the services and experiences that customers desireâ€¦ Making the high street relevant again.

With its Software as a Service (SAAS) model, Scoop Retail aims to democratise the evolution of bricks and mortar retail, and help to deliver the stores of the future, today.

The aim of this fund raise is to give us the security we need over the next 6 to 9 months while we continue to build and scale the business.

This campaign is to effect the pre-emption rights that the investors who invested in the Collider campaign have as shareholders of Scoop Retail. As it is a pre-emption campaign, limited information about the company is being provided.

An update from the Scoop Retail team on the progress of the business can be requested in order to get further information.
