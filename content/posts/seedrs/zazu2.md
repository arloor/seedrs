## Idea

### Introduction

Having received it's Payments Licence from the Bank of Zambia, Zazu is aiming to launching it's digital banking app in Q1 2019.

Born from Ignite Accelerator as an e-commerce platform for farmers, Zazu has now pivoted to become a 21st century bank for Africa. Zazu is developing a banking app to offer a real-time log of consumer's spending and control over how finances are used.

Zazu have also developed 5 online courses that teach people about how money really works, for free. In a 4 month pilot, this content was accessed by 6,185 people, 15,000 times. A nationwide campaign will be launched, advertising #100DaysofLiteracy, encouraging people from all walks of life to take these free courses.

Zazu is planning a bigger funding round once it has launched.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only for existing shareholders, limited information is being provided at this time.
