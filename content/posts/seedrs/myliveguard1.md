## Idea

### Introduction

We are a smart home provider (Home Automation, Home Security &amp; CCTV), with our difference being that we run our smart home software 'over the top' of set top boxes/TV's/Games Consoles to turn that device into a smart home hub. We are very engaged with both Telcos, insurance companies and set top box manufacturers to deliver our solution onto either a new 'multi use' device (home automation, videos streaming &amp; gaming), or onto a device that may already be in the home. Initially our hub software runs on Android. Client apps are both Android &amp; iPhone.

This is a pre-emption round, open to existing shareholders only. As such, a limited amount of information has been provided as part of this campaign.
