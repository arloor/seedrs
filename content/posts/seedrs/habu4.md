## Idea

### Introduction

Habu is software powering coworking hubs &amp; and a new generation of flexible workspaces that are opening up around the world.

Our mission is twofold. On the one hand, Habu is all about making managing bookings and building buzzing spaces a whole lot easier for those overworked space managers. And on the other, it’s is about improving the onboarding of new members and their day-to-day experience of a hub. What matters to our customers (space managers) is that they’ve got lots of customers (members) and that they’re happy. That’s why we created Habu. It’s beautifully designed to make managing bookings, payments and spaces quick and effortless.

We launched Habu in September and already have customers in the UK, US, Canada &amp; South Africa. We’ve also expanded our team bringing on industry specific marketing expertise and are adding tech talent to enable us to increase feature development on our enterprise grade SaaS platform.
