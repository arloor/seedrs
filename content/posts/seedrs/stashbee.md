## Idea

### Introduction

In many areas, space has never been at such a premium, and we live in an era where people have more belongings than ever before. Stashbee aims to reinvent the way we store stuff for the sharing economy generation.

Our easy-to-use platform connects individuals &amp; businesses who have spare space (garages, spare rooms, parking spaces, warehouses) with those who need it (private and business storage, parking, warehousing). Think of it as Airbnb for storage.

For our Guests, we offer secure, vetted, local spaces at affordable prices. Meanwhile we empower our Hosts with an easy way to earn additional income.

Our world-class website automates the end-to-end booking process, seamlessly processes payments, and offers a powerful and easy-to-use dashboard for Guests and Hosts to interact and manage bookings. We make the process safe and secure by running ID checks. We also provide insurance, which is powered by Guardhog and underwritten by Hiscox and is specifically designed for peer-to-peer storage, to cover people's stored items.

### Intended impact

People everywhere are increasingly looking beyond their homes for storage space. Self-storage options can be pricey and inconveniently located, and we consider that there aren't many alternatives out there.

Having felt this pain ourselves, we set out to see if others had the same problem. We spoke to everyone from house-movers to ex-pats, and from growing businesses to car collectors. We found one thing to be true: finding spare space is hard.

Meanwhile, we estimate that there are 1.5 billion square feet of under-utilised space in warehouses, spare rooms &amp; garages right across the UK which is sitting idle and untapped.

Our platform harnesses the power of the sharing economy to allow people and businesses to find and book spare space in garages, spare rooms, parking spaces and warehouses. At the same time, we're providing a hassle-free way for people with idle space to make extra income.

Stashbee aims to make storage space easy, affordable and convenient for everyone, everywhere.

### Competition strategy

Stashbee's PEER-TO-PEER STORAGE MODEL is set to disrupt conventional storage. We believe that we are well positioned to be UK market leader:

• Incredibly low-capex business model (we don't need to build or lease warehouses, whilst our traditional competitors do!). <br>• Location convenience (we can provide storage locations anywhere, to everyone). <br>• Low cost (we are more affordable than traditional storage solutions). <br>• Funded (to our knowledge we are the best funded peer-to-peer storage company in the UK). <br>• Customer-first approach (9.5 out of 10 on TrustPilot). <br>• Fantastic tech team and product (we are a tech company, unlike our traditional competitors).

Existing solutions in the market include:

• TRADITIONAL SELF-STORAGE: Storage unit lets, typically in large purpose built facilities. <br>• CONCIERGE SELF-STORAGE: Out-of-town facilities with focus on per-item storage and logistics. <br>• GARAGES &amp; PARKING: Long term rental of garages &amp; parking spaces.
