## Idea

### Introduction

Now in our 4th year of trading Shavekit.com is a proven concept seeing consistent growth with over 60,000 customers (20,000 active).

We’ve continued our philosophy of lean growth, keeping overheads low and focusing on improving the key drivers of our business performance. This has put us in a great position of burning minimal cash.

We’ve moved out of our central London office to a combined warehouse and office in Surrey, cutting our rent and fulfillment costs, hired a warehouse team, taken on flexible customer service staff.

The company has a loan of £30,000 that it is paying back at c. £2,000 pcm.

This is a pre-emption campaign open only to existing investors. As such, limited information is being provided at this time.
