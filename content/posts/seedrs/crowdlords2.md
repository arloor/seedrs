## Idea

### Introduction

We connect Investors and Property Professionals so that more people can benefit from investing in property.

Since launching in 2015, Crowdlords model has evolved from a Buy-to-Let equity based investment platform to a wider property crowdfunding platform that includes funding for developments and other commercial property assets. We recently launched the Debt investment and will be soon launching an IFISA product.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only to existing investors, limited information is being provided at this time.

Please note that the company has two loans totalling Â£240,000. Funds raised in this campaign will not be used to finance this loan.
