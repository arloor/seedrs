## Idea

Please note that the Company has a unique share structure which is slightly different to the standard equity campaigns that appear on Seedrs. The Company has provided a document which explains the structure and what it means for investors. You can download this document from the documents section of the campaign and we recommend that you read this before deciding to invest.

### Introduction

In November 2014, we opened M Threadneedle Street; our award-winning, multifaceted venue, which houses two 100-cover restaurants, a destination cocktail bar, a wine-tasting room &amp; private dining.

M Victoria Street, our second venue opened in early 2016; Again multifaceted (and with the addition of a very cool wine store and a private members bar), again award winning.

NOW IT'S TIME FOR 'M SOCIAL': Local venues designed to accommodate: A modern Cocktail and Wine Bar, a casual all day ‘Social Bar Food’ offering &amp; a Grill Restaurant. The time of day will dictate the demand for each of these elements, which have been designed to maximise sales opportunities &amp; accommodate demand.

Our first 'M Social' venue is expected to be a new 100 cover 'Butlers Wharf’ style building, complete with a riverside view and outside terrace.

The proposed venue sits directly opposite a mainline station, is ideally positioned to serve daily commuters &amp; become a genuine ‘Home from Home’ for residents, visitors and local businesses.

Here’s a behind the scenes video about M….

### Intended impact

The ethos of M is simple – Aspirational yet accessible drinking and dining in a comfortable, quality environment, offering world class products, plus the finest examples of hospitality and guest recognition which create a ‘home from home’ for a community of guests, who appreciate who we are and feel a sense of belonging to the brand.

Through technology and world class hospitality, we aim to create fantastic local hub hotspots in the suburbs of Greater London, that complement our two flagship venues in Central London.

### Monetisation strategy

The multi-faceted structure of the M venues give us a number of revenue streams. Guests visit M for a glass of wine, beer or a most excellent cocktail, which drives strong ‘wet’ sales. M Wine Store and its online sister <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="outside" href="http://www.mwinestore.co.uk">www.mwinestore.co.uk</a> also drive additional revenues to M and of course the ‘hero offering’ for which M has become so highly regarded is the food and wine offerings that make for a perfect breakfast, lunch or dinner. <br> <br>The above makes M a very robust model, as does the addition of our new M Social brand, which is designed to attract the same guests who enjoy our flagship central London venues and cater of the for their personal drinking and dining needs ‘close to home.’

### Use of proceeds

1. Accelerate growth and ‘ring-fence’ £1.1M to fund the CAPEX of Restaurant Three – M SOCIAL.

2. Build and open a 50 Cover M DEN Private Members Lounge in the basement of M Threadneedle St.

3. Build working capital to support the business in both the short and long term.

Our Growth Strategy is to i) grow to maturity the two flagship central London sites and ii) facilitate the growth of the brand through 2 smaller less central venues with materially lower rents and capex requirements. These venues will be a more casual lower price point variant of the current offering appealing to the significant amount of evening and weekend trade in residential areas of high disposable income and high numbers of commuter residents, who are already familiar with the M brand.

The business currently has an overdraft facility worth £100k and asset based loans worth £800,877.17. None of the funds raised will be used to repay these debts.

## Market

### Target market

Please take a moment to view both our campaign video and our 'inside M' short film that tells you the story behind the brand and the people who are part of it.

Our current offering at both M Threadneedle St and M Victoria St attracts a large span of demographics aging between 25-65 years in age, with fairly equal gender split. Through our diversity of use and broad appeal, we aim to continue to grow our community of investors, M Den members and regular guests further by offering outstanding hospitality and guest recognition, coupled with a diverse world class, international food and beverage offering.

### Characteristics of target market

Our new ‘M Social’ venues will reflect all of the above, in a local ‘clubhouse’ environment. To create the same award-winning offering, but in residential destinations; will be a first. As our two ‘Flagship M Venues’ continue to grow in reputation and become institutions in the City and Central London, the emergence of M Social venues opening in areas of Greater London, where many of our current and future diners live, will grow the brand recognition further still.

### Marketing strategy

Key to both our PR and Marketing campaigns are the quality of the offering and the people behind it.

Executive Chef Michael Reid, has just released a cookbook and is expected to star on a high profile TV show in the next year. He is currently launching RAW, our 100% Gluten Free restaurant, housed alongside our Grill Restaurant in M Victoria St.

Director of Wines Zack Charilaou, won Best Sommelier / FOH of the year in the Harpers Awards and has a unique and refreshing approach to both how we serve wine and our wine list offering. The M Wine Store and it’s online sister also reflect this spirit as do a series of imaginative wine led dinners, in our venues

Michael and Zack’s talents and menus have created an amazing offering that lends itself perfectly to both attracting press coverage and creating exciting engaging reasons for people to visit M.

Supporting the engaging activity and the attraction of the brand; which drives both corporate and destination dining to it is a strategy (headed up by our Marketing Manager Stacey Anderson) of cover driving through the maximisation of relationships with Hotel Concierges, PA &amp; EA’s, events companies, local business engagement and booking affiliates.

### Competition strategy

Our competition strategy? Very simple! To be aspirational, but accessible. Low priced entry points on all menus which also boast the finest and often very rare ingredients from around the world.

From a hospitality perspective M drives positive memorable experiences, diner appreciation and guest recognition – we go so far with this, that you can even choose which table you would like to sit at in advance online and we never give a ‘turn time’!

Our venues are beautiful and multi-faceted, perfect to visit to drink dine (or both) from breakfast until midnight, boasting private dining facilities that from 8-500 guests.

The team, venue and offering are the best of the best. We believe that diners are tiring of the dull offering of chain restaurants and being treated as a nameless number when visiting restaurants; M is the future of drinking and dining.
