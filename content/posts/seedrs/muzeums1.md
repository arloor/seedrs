## Idea

### Introduction

Muzeums is an app and platform for museums that manages the visitor experience. The museum gets a full dashboard in which it controls content and gets analytics, and the visitors get a unique individual experience based on their personal interests and learning style.

In other words, when a visitor uses Muzeums, the app can create, on the spot, an experience that is tailored specifically for them,­ with the content that they're interested in, and even delivered in their preferred way, be it a media tour guide or a real-­time interactive social game. The museum controls all the content and gets the analytics about the visitor's data and behaviour in the museum.

We have gathered an award-winning team to work on Muzeums - our team of employees have created "Europeana Beacon", a location based cultural heritage app integrating beacon technology, which won the Apps4Europe award in the 2014 Pisa Hackathon, and was promoted by Europeana. Muzeums was also featured on Europeana Labs website.

We have created a fully functional backend dashboard for the museum to control all content and deliver analytics, and fully functional beautiful apps on iOS and Android for the visitor, available to download for free.

### Market

In order to successfully penetrate the market, we will need to use different methods, but our main method will be to map a large city (we already started with London), and add as many institutions (potential clients) as possible to the system, with only a visibility layer - which means only opening hours, map etc. are available. After an institution is added we will approach them to convert them into a paying customer. Our goal is to do this process with at least 3 large cities by the end of the year - London, Paris/Berlin/Amsterdam and NYC.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only for existing shareholders, minimum details are being provided. More information on Muzeums is available on the company's website. Please note, this information has not been verified or approved by Seedrs.
