## Idea

### Introduction

RT Objects is creating new ways for brands to sell and tell stories online - a cloud platform that delivers personal interactive CGI in the browser.

The company has recently raised £34,000 in convertible equity. As an existing investor you are entitled to participate in the new round on a pro rata basis.

The key terms that apply are as follows:

• Discount – conversion to equity at the lower of (i) a 25% discount to the valuation set by a Trigger Event or (ii) the valuation cap of £6,000,000.

• Conversion is automatically triggered by the following Trigger Events:

o A Qualifying Financing Round – defined as the a subscription for equity (ordinary shares) of at least £150,000;

o A change of control or IPO of the company;

• Longstop Date: December 2018.

• If conversion has not been triggered by the longstop date, shares will be issued on the date at a valuation based on the lower of (i) a pre-money company valuation of £1,250,000; or (ii) the lowest price for any share issued after the date of the convertible agreement.
