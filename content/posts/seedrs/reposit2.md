# [Reposit](https://www.seedrs.com/reposit2)

## Idea

Reposit offers an alternative to tenancy deposits. For many, private renting is likely one of the largest financial burdens they have. On top of this a tenancy deposit will be one of the single biggest lump sum financial outlays a young person will make. With agency fees, a months rent in advance and a six week holding deposit, for many it is becoming at best a struggle or at worst unaffordable.

Reposit offers a solution, by charging tenants a non-refundable fee of one weeks rent. In return Reposit will guarantee to the landlord or Letting Agent up to the value of six weeks rent. The tenant remains liable for any damages caused and will be liable to Reposit for a legitimate claim at the end of the tenancy. Landlords get a faster payout and more cover. Letting agents receive commission on every Reposit sold and tenants save considerably on their down payment. Everybody wins.

Please note, as this is a pre-emption campaign open only to existing investors, limited information is being provided at this time.
