## Idea

### Introduction

Quite simply, the market for PixelPin is the replacement of passwords. The use of pictures to replace passwords has many advantages. According to the study of ‘Picture Superiority Effect’ the human brain processes pictures in a different way to the way in which words are committed to memory, therefore making it easier for a human to remember visually rather than in word format. Moreover, pictures have a significant advantage over the password as they are difficult to hack, provide no language barriers and are easy to use regardless of your ability or disability.
