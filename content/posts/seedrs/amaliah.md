## Idea

### Introduction

Amaliah offers curated modest fashion based on what influencers are wearing on social media. A muslim woman sees an outfit on her favourite blogger and then comes onto Amaliah to buy it in it's individual components. Amaliah is tapping into the largely untapped Muslim fashion market.

We are two sisters who are aiming to solve a problem faced by millions of Muslim Women. Muslim women want to look good and cover up. We are passionate about building a platform that represents and empowers Muslim women. We are not building Amaliah because 'we don't like working for people,' think it is a cool thing to do or want to be 'entrepreneurs'.

In fact, building Amaliah feels more like a responsibility. We are driven by the want to solve a problem for the community we come from.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only for existing shareholders, minimum details are being provided. More information on Amaliah is available on the company's website. Please note, this information has not been verified or approved by Seedrs.
