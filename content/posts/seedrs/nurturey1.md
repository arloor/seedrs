## Idea

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/4901/57hhe1tdp8ak3d6kfa71k9wx6iyh48l/NurtureyMain.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1196%2C800&w=600&fit=clip&s=31ae44781a7d1dfb24fa70b5a4c0928d)

### Introduction

Problem: <br>On one hand, parents have to manage an onslaught of routine information, documents, activities, etc; on the other, it is difficult for parents to follow, let alone implement, overwhelming amount of information/resources available today on parenting.

Proposition: <br>Nurturey helps parents digitise and simplify their journey in an intuitive, appealing and frictionless manner.

Vision: <br>Globally, signing up on Nurturey will be one of the first steps parents take when they conceive. It will be the 'go-to' platform for parents for digital tools that will set them free of anxiety in their parental journey.

Description <br>With its ORGANISE, NURTURE, TEAM-UP and CHERISH model, Nurturey offers productivity tools to manage every aspect of life around kids. Moreover, it aims to connect parents with only the most relevant information/resources, empowering them to be pro-active in nurturing their children. And with multi-device access, Nurturey aims to bring control to parents' fingertips.

### Intended impact

Digitisation is an irreversible phenomenon of the modern world; and Nurturey will bring its benefits to the parents and parenting.

### Monetisation strategy

After achieving significant base of engaged users, we will implement one or a mix of the following revenue models:

We aim to make a total revenue of £50/YEAR per customer/family, through a combination of all these revenue models.

A) Transaction cut: <br>- We are building several algorithms. Based on the rich data, Nurturey's algorithms would connect parents to the most appropriate resources (free/paid, online/offline) at the most appropriate time. <br>- In case a paid transaction takes place, we believe we could charge a commission of 25-30%. <br>- e.g., On Nurturey' recommendation, if a consultation with a psychologist takes place or an e-learning product is purchased, we can charge a commission.

B) Subscription/Freemium based: <br>- Standard (free) and premium subscription. - While all features will be free, volumes of services may be limited. e.g. for more than 100 items in 'timeline', premium subscription required.

Currently we are not aiming to implement advertisements based business models.

### Use of proceeds

Invest to build two pillars: Consumer (the King) and Product (the Queen)

Major objectives: <br>- Drive user base expansion and engagement. <br>- Enhance the product by adding flagship and addictive features across devices .

The money will be allocated approximately as below: <br>1) 40% Product enhancement. <br>2) 25% Marketing - user acquisition. <br>3) 15% Marketing - brand enhancement. <br>4) 17% Admin &amp; overheads. <br>5) 3% Server and infrastructure.

## Market

### Target market

1) Customer segment: <br>Nurturey's customers are parents who are either in pregnancy phase or have kids in the age range of 0-10. <br>Our current launch aimed at parents with kids in 0-3 years range, but we will now expand this further with product enhancement.

2) Geographical segment: <br>a) We position Nurturey as a global platform, especially where English language works. <br>b) Our initial brand building efforts are in the UK, US and Indian market. <br>c) India is a key market for us, due to its world's largest youth (parents and soon to be parents) population. If we don’t build traction in India, a copycat competitor can become bigger.

3) Segment size (our estimates): <br>a) UK: approx. 4-5 million families in our target range. <br>b) India (top-25 Indian cities): There are aprox. 10-12 million middle class families in target range. <br>c) US: Approx 25 million in target range.

Just these first three markets themselves represent a segment size of over 40million families in the target range.

### Characteristics of target market

We estimate our market size is £25 billion for UK, US and India. <br>This is an estimate of total revenue opportunities relevant to our monetisation strategy,which is the commission earning opportunities, on only non-school spend online by parents.

Our calculations are based on the following assumptions: <br>- 30% spend is done online, of all non-school spend by parents. <br>- 30% average commission opportunity, on each transaction, as sales agents.

### Marketing strategy

A) Immediate to medium term strategy <br>We have developed our user acquisition and brand building capabilities around Facebook, for the following reasons: <br>- More than 10-15 million daily active FB users in our target base.

Our strategy is backed by the results so far. <br>-We have achieved, what we feel to be, a competitively low customer acquisition cost. <br>- Acquisition rate so far has been proportional to our marketing spend. In fact the rate tends to increase marginally faster on spend increase. <br>- We aim to increase daily sign up rate to more than 1000, once we have launched the app for public, by increasing acquisition spend.

B) Medium to long-term strategy: <br>With time we will also develop following three key channels:

1) Schools/ Parent networks/ Clubs: <br>- Market directly to primary/ preparatory schools to whom we will provide our free solutions.

2) Online advertisement channels: <br>- Ads on parenting websites such as, Mumsnet, Babycenter etc, which have many unique users per month each in target age group.

3) Referrals: <br>- As our user base will reach a critical mass, parent referral will have significant proportion in new customer acquisition. <br>- This will happen on referral or when parents create a group inviting other parents to join.

### Competition strategy

1) Direct competitors: <br>- We are not aware of any competition with direct and significant overlap of features.

2) Indirect/Partial competitors: <br>a) Piecemeal solution providers or tools. <br>- Solutions such as kids photo up-load websites, on-line/printed family calendars, milestone trackers etc. <br>- We feel that such platforms bring neither a comprehensive nor frictionless experience for parents. We believe its not possible for parents to manage several solutions, and would rather prefer a single platform that is accessible, meaningful and easy to use.

b) School softwares: <br>- Some school softwares have extensions for parents. However these solutions are aimed at school-parent communication. <br>- Nurturey provides solution for Parent (and communication among parents), with limited extension to schools. <br>- In fact, we plan to partner with some school software solution providers, and Nurturey expects to emerge as the 'parent front-end' for school solutions.

3) Complementaries (content providers): <br>- Companies such as Babycenter, Mumsnet or e-learning platforms would be our complementaries. <br>- Nurturey is not a content provider and aims to often guide users to other content platforms as appropriate.
