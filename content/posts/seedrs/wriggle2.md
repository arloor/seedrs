## Idea

### Introduction

Wriggle is a web and app marketplace platform that allows customer to discover and transact at handpicked eat-out food &amp; drink businesses.

With 70,000 transactions already, our business model is proven. We are now operating profitably in Bristol*, our first city, and have a replicable roll-out strategy successfully tested in Cardiff (170% ahead of Bristol in revenue at the same stage).

The strategy is to prepare ourselves for a roll-out in 2018. We aim to hit breakeven across the business in mid-2018 - and in doing so (whilst trading in only 3 cities), we'll be in an excellent position to roll Wriggle out across the UK and internationally.

To ensure that we have enough cash to trade through this Breakeven target, we’re raising a £300,000 EIS round - which will allow us to prepare our platform for a roll-out.
