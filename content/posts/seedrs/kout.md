## Idea

### Introduction

Kout is a e-commerce platform where customers play a free lottery game for a chance to win their shopping basket, from retailers including Amazon, Nike, Nintendo, Samsung. If they’re not lucky to win, they still get a time limited discount to redeem instantly, increasing retailer’s conversion rate to as well as driving incremental revenues. As a premium package, brands can customise their games and integrate it with their own websites. Kout is backed by Collider.io, a top madtech accelerator in the UK, and launched in beta during summer 2016.

This is a pre-emption campaign open to existing investors only. As such, limited information is being provided at this time.

Please note: Kout raised £38,100 during 2016 at a pre-money valuation of £650,000 and has recently secured another £60,000 of investment at a pre-money valuation of £1,400,000. Seedrs investors are being given the chance to exercise their pre-emption rights on the full round at the £650,000 valuation.
