## Idea

### Introduction

**BRIDGE ROUND - JUNE 2017 <br>Based on the excellent progress we've made since closing our last Seedrs round in December, we're soon closing a smaller round of funding in order to continue to support the fast growth we've seen the past months. This round sees a couple of new, well-connected investors joining and the funds will take us into next year. <br>We will aim to demonstrate stronger metrics including 12+ months of growth and 6+ months of revenue, allowing us to raise a larger round at a much higher valuation in order to expand even more rapidly.

Thank you for your continued support.
