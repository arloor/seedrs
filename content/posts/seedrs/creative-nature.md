## Idea

### Introduction

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/15406/kywjdi4ag8u4x9ii5btuzo4xs09yl8c/Introduction_-_Baking_Mixes.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C600%2C322&w=600&fit=clip&s=113ec32e4f9f9ce57699735d303acc11)

Living with allergies is hard enough, without having to read ingredients lists with a magnifying glass.

The Creative Nature team has made it simple, by creating a range of organic baking mixes that cater for the Top 14 Allergens, as well as being refined sugar free and having a vegan recipe on pack.

We've also produced a unique range of snack bars that are allergy-friendly. Our products have won 11 Great Taste Gold stars since 2014.

100% self-funded, the brand is now stocked in over 3,500 stores across the UK, online through Ocado &amp; Amazon and in 11 countries worldwide.

44% of British adults now suffer from at least 1 allergy and the amount of vegan consumers in the UK has risen by a staggering 548% since 2016 to reach 3.5 million.

Our current 2018 run-rate is £1.2 million* with exciting new product and store launches still to come. <br>*Calculated using unaudited management accounts from Q2 2018.

### Intended impact

Owner, Julianne (IoD's Young Director of the Year) created the products out of frustration at the lack of allergy-friendly, tasty snacks that weren't full of additives. We feel most new snack bar companies all start out because of a "lack of healthy options in the market", but Julianne struggled to eat what was available without fear of dying!.

It's no exaggeration, anaphylaxis is the "severe and sometimes fatal allergic reaction to a foreign substance". In the 20 years prior to 2012, there was a 615% increase in the rate of hospital admissions for anaphylaxis in the UK.

With most food brands only focusing on 1 or 2 allergens, Creative Nature have spotted a gap in the market to be free from the top 14 allergens. More than 150 million Europeans currently suffer from chronic allergies and by 2025 it's estimated half of the entire EU population will be affected.

Creative Nature caters for these consumers, whilst appealing to a mass market through award-winning great tasting products.

### Monetisation strategy

Creative Nature has 4 main revenue streams which stem from our 3 core product ranges; Free From, Organic Home Baking Mixes, Allergen Friendly Snack Bars and Superfoods to add to drinks or food.

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/15413/mkkjs9fqc59tynqfd0rmk6gs3u3dmqg/Monetisation_Strategy__after_1st_paragraph_.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C600%2C341&w=600&fit=clip&s=2ca102aa7a71c4b72554783d62ff1199)

The 4 revenue streams are: <br>- Retailers. <br>- Wholesalers/ Distributors and Independents. <br>- Export/ Overseas Distributors. <br>- Online Web Sales.

Creative Nature source many products direct from the country of origin, like India or New Zealand, which we believe is better in terms of supply chain and traceability control.

We ensure that our product manufacturing is performed in the UK, with each site gaining BRC A standard or higher, for quality control.

Over the next 12 months we aim to increase our market share in the UK Supermarkets, Catering and Wholesale, as well as focus on International expansion through export.

We plan to launch an online subscription model with the aim being to increase our website revenue.

We also intend to increase volumes across all our ranges.

### Use of proceeds

We have a proven product in the market from the traction we have seen and the listings that we have secured into major supermarkets. We are now looking to scale up our Sales and Marketing.

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/15423/sx6lef81x1zc9yb0gkhz822xnhhjrrl/NEWUse_of_Proceeds_-_Media__2_.jpg?rect=0%2C-2%2C588%2C398&w=600&fit=clip&s=0b65f8b463c1a70c6e4dd0bf273f1f8a)

With this raise we intend to:

1. Increase personnel including hiring 2 more National Sales Account Managers who have a proven track record and relationships in FMCG. Other roles will include General Manager, Customer Support, Marketing Support.

2. Use for working capital including scaling up production to prevent running out of stock, which we believe will enable growth.

3. Accelerate our marketing including consumer shows, events, ambassadors, content creation, digital advertising and POS.

4. Operational capacity, we will need to increase warehousing and streamline processes to improve efficiency.

5. Launch new products (development takes about 1 year from conception to launch) and packaging innovation, including moving all packaging to sustainable material.

### Characteristics of target market

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/15416/2rnj57jrhosrx40521rgchoywrkyq9s/Characteristics_of_target_market__top_bit_.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C600%2C398&w=600&fit=clip&s=1f233b5d1125183919cb31a7086a348d)

In 2016, the Global Free-From category was valued at $32bn, whilst the Organic industry was worth $36bn. The Free From market in the UK alone is set to grow to £673M by 2020. Globally the Gluten Free industry alone is set to grow to $4.7bn by 2020.

The market for Vegan products has grown significantly too, with consumers switching to dairy free alternatives. In 2016, 540,000 people over 15 identified as vegan in the UK, this has now increased to 3.5 million (that's about 7% of the population!). Uber Eats saw an increase of over 322% in vegan food searches. Last year, Guinness went vegan and stopped using fish bladders in its brewing process, after two and a half centuries!

Big supermarket brands like Tesco and M&amp;S are launching their own vegan ranges to cater for increased demand.

The 3 categories we fall into are:

1) Free From Snacking. <br>Vegan, Allergy-Friendly, Repeat Buyers.

2) Home-Baking. <br>Vegan recipe, Allergen-Free, Easy-to-Bake.

3) Superfoods. <br>Ethically Sourced, Premium Quality.

### Marketing strategy

Educate consumers, building a brand they can trust.

Being completely self-funded, we have had to be resourceful with very little resource. We've gained free exposure through Dragon's Den, Britain's Next Top Model, Sky News, multiple award wins and many more.

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/15418/ggic7631kmwhj23e325ix6l3g1zv0z2/Marketing_Strategy__above__Event_Marketing__.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C600%2C338&w=600&fit=clip&s=f87c7904dfa29d6d29f8d82759cee1f3)

Event Marketing. <br>- Big stunts including our Creative Nature Vegan Bake Off for the launch of our new mixes. <br>- We aim to present in 55 shows per year.

PR Marketing. <br>Education through editorial features in publications like The Independent, The Daily Mail, The Telegraph, BBC 5 Live and more. We believe this builds trust with the consumer, rather than a paid advertisement.

Retail POS/ Sampling. <br>We will be driving sales through merchandising, recipe books, promotions and sampling.

Social Media. <br>We have over 50,000 social media followers across all our platforms, with CEO, Julianne, having a significant social following too.

Website. <br>We plan to launch our subscription box with re-targeted ads across social media to help drive loyal fans and sustainable sales.

Email Marketing. <br>We will provide exclusive offers to subscribers.

Digital Advertising.

### Competition strategy

Although crowded, the Free From industry is ever expanding. We believe there are gaping holes in the market, begging for innovation.

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/15422/er8yyt7hv9imbi5j3p0o7lnzkjlwmm2/Competition_Strategy__after__begging_for_innovation__.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C599%2C391&w=600&fit=clip&s=463169b217574089beb98e3cf46a1e65)

In our opinion, we feel the baking industry hadn't been shaken up for years. We feel that this was the reason why our unique mixes were instantly named in the Top New Product launches in the category in Sainsbury's.

People trust people, therefore we believe that having a founder, Julianne, who suffers from anaphylaxis and openly talks about her struggles, gives the brand credibility.

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/15420/fwdsgemp3lbad918rvlrp0znpfip555/Competition_Strategy__after__brand_credibility__.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C600%2C412&w=600&fit=clip&s=cef0333483a1bf9f52aad09a9a02a456)

We believe we differentiate ourselves by looking to tick ALL the boxes. Not only allergen-free, but affordable and tasty too. We're the only brand to ever win 2 Great Taste Gold Stars for a cold-pressed bar.

Healthy snacking needs to be attainable, which is why we price our bars at the lower market range, offering consumers greater value for money than more expensive competitors.

More brands will enter the market, jumping on the bandwagon and offering slightly different takes on a tried and tested recipe formation. We believe our constant innovation and creative marketing will ensure we'll strive to stay ahead.
