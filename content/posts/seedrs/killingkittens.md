### Introduction

Killing Kittens is a female empowerment brand, promoting positivity for women of all ages and sizes. We do this by creating extraordinary experiences - both online and offline.

Our social network app is home to over 100,000 liberated members, who use our platform to connect with like-minded people, brands and content. Our world-famous events are held in over 12 countries, where we partner with top brands to deliver unforgettable experiences the world over. Whether it’s our inspiring workshops, Kurious social nights or our renowned parties, we deliver experiences at all stages of the sexual liberation and empowerment journey.

We employ a female-first attitude in everything we do. We put women in control and encourage integrity, respect, confidence and body positivity for all. Up until now, KK has remained an underground movement, but we are ready and determined to take KK to the world, enabling the total fulfilment, freedom, expression and safety of millions of women globally.

### Intended impact

Female inequality is dominating the media. We believe the world is changing and we’re on the verge of seeing social, economic and sexual equality. KK was formed in 2005 with the vision of a female-first future and we’re now part of the millennial female-empowerment movement, which has since swept social media and popular culture, including female-first dating apps like Bumble, and the #TimesUp campaign.

Created in response to demand from young, independent women and couples who needed something more, we created exclusive and decadent events that are fully focused on the pursuit of female pleasure - where women are in control. We set out to create a safe and fun environment, where the stigma of sexual expression was left at the door.

Since 2005, Killing Kittens has moved beyond just events and has grown a loyal online community of women, gentlemen and couples – connecting and meeting all over the world.

### Monetisation strategy

Offline - we generate revenue through ticket sales for our events held around the world. Ticket buyers must be members of the KK social platform in order to purchase tickets. Eligibility rules apply for certain events e.g. for KK Parties, once they are members, females and couples are eligible to purchase tickets, however single males must be invited by a female or couple.

The near future will see us expand on brand alliances, sponsorships and retail revenue from brand apparel.

Online - The KK web app is free to use for the basic membership with a nominal sign-up fee, but users must pay a monthly subscription in order to use some of the premium features on the platform.

### Use of proceeds

70% Growth Marketing - We intend on increasing brand awareness to grow our community. This involves a fully specced marketing activation campaign in the UK and US.

15% Product innovation - With our new technology already being built, we aim to increase online revenue and retention from new and existing subscribers.

10% Hiring - Talent acquisition to build out from the core team. Senior staff have already been identified.

The company has £50,000 outstanding loans, however none of the proceeds of investment are intended to be used to repay this.

## Market

### Target market

We operate in the sex tech and dating market. Our current target demographic are affluent ABC1’s, aged between 28-42 and are predominantly based in the London area. They typically spend on premium brands and have an average annual income of £60,000. Our demographic is a relatively even split of 50:50 female to male. We will primarily target females to become advocates of the brand to help grow awareness to both males and females.

A large portion of our users (70%) use the KK web app on mobile and have used other mobile dating apps like Tinder, Bumble and Feeld.

We’ll use this profile as a springboard on who to target for user acquisition to the app, which will be a large part of our marketing campaign.

We will be targeting a slightly younger demographic as we shift focus to growth of the app as well as expanding our target locations to the US to capitalise on this large market.

### Characteristics of target market

There are currently over 300m dating app users in the world, generating a revenue of $1.3bn revenue (2017).

### Marketing strategy

We intend on rolling out a global activation campaign in 2019 and have identified major cities identified around the world, that contain a high yield of our core demographic.

We've selected marketing channels to reach our target market for both acquisition and retention. Many of the channels overlap and support each other but all contribute to our marketing objectives. They will be used in a global activation campaign where we will deploy them in a designated city until we reach critical mass, upon moving to the next major city. These channels include:

- Content marketing and delivery <br>- Email marketing <br>- Social media marketing <br>- SEO <br>- Brand alliances <br>- Paid advertising <br>- Experiential marketing <br>- Out-of-home display ads <br>- PR

By using these channels, we've constructed a customer journey that leads a potential customer from awareness, to discoverability, to researching, to conversion and finally to advocacy as we strive to delight our customers and create loyal fans.

### Competition strategy

Although we could be mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Tinder, Bumble and Feeld in terms of dating, content and e-commerce, we're placed more as a premium and luxury brand, which we convey in our tone of voice, design and experiences.

We're also uniquely placed at the crossroads of online and offline experiences and are aligned with the likes of Playboy, Agent Provocateur and Lelo with regards to events and retail (future). We pride ourselves in offering premium and quality digital and physical experiences to create strong brand loyalty to help foster our global community.

Our view of the competition:
