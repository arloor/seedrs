## Idea

### Introduction

Since our successful Seedrs crowdfunding campaign in 2015, which over-funded by 26% with 126 individual investors, we have managed to grow turnover by 180% in the 16/17 financial year.

Following on from this success we decided to run a private fundraising round in 2017 - the objective of this was to raise capital for continued growth throughout 2018 and to also bring on-board a principle investor that could take on a board role for the company.

We're pleased to announce that the fundraising round was successful - as such we'll welcome Rob Murphy on-board as a non-executive director and are opening up the pre-emption round to all preexisting shareholders.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only for existing shareholders, minimum details are being provided. If you would like to see our investment deck which includes all the details of this round - including current information on the brand, our products, how we plan on growing the business, our historical sales and financial forecasts - please select the 'Request Documents' button.

We thank you all for your continued support.

Please note that the company currently has an unsecured Business Loan for £25,000 taken out in January 2018, payable over 2 years and direct loans for £32,646. The funds raised as part of this round will not be used to pay these loans.
