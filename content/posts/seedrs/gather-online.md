# [Gather Online](https://www.seedrs.com/gather-online)

## Idea

### Introduction

Gather Online is a social discovery platform where you can meet like-minded people through time-limited conversations on topics that interest you.

Research shows that we never speak to 89% of the connections we add on social media, so these connections aren't meaningful.

To achieve meaningful connections, we need to have direct back and forth communication, but traditional social media creates little urgency, so people tend to become passive consumers of content. Therefore, we believe traditional online groups donâ€™t work for meeting new people - they quickly become stale, with few people remaining active, and little direct engagement.

On Gather, because you are in a conversation group on a topic that interests you, and there is an urgency created by the time limit, we see a lot of interaction and direct engagement. Thus people are able to establish meaningful social or business connections, or form romantic relationships with others where they genuinely have something in common.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

This is a pre-emption campaign for Seedrs investors to participate in a new round of funding for Gather Online, where the company is issuing up to 1,944,444 new shares at a share price of A$0.72 up to a maximum amount of A$1.4M.

Before the launch of this campaign a total A$1,162,500 has been raised. Any increase in this amount will be shown on the amount raised bar at the top of the campaign.

Gather Online is an Australian company and therefore shares will be issued in Australian Dollars at a GBP:AUD$ exchange rate of 1.774.

The company currently has A$100k in loans owed to a financier which are due by October 2018. These are offset against a grant - the Research and Development tax incentive - for which the company received A$120k last financial year, and expects to receive more this year. Thus the loan is covered by this grant and investment funds are not needed to pay off debt.
