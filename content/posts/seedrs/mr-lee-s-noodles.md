## Idea

### Introduction

Mr Lee's Noodles is a breakthrough in affordable healthy fast food and the way it is delivered, disrupting poor quality snack and convenience food sectors which are large, established and ripe for change; it's the ‘Premiumisation of an existing category.

Mr Lee's Noodles are raising a total of £1m, including Seedrs's pre-emption amount. If the aggregate pre-emption rights for Seedrs are not fully taken up then external investors will make up the difference.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only for existing shareholders, minimum details are being provided. More information on Mr Lee's Noodles can be found by requesting access to the attached documents. Please note, this information has not been verified or approved by Seedrs.
