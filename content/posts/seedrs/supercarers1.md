## Idea

### Introduction

SuperCarers is an introductory service which helps connect individuals and organisations with trusted, experienced and fully vetted carers in their area. We believe that - in most circumstances - the best placed people to coordinate high quality, personalised care are the families and care professionals themselves.

Unlike an agency, which directs and manages the delivery of care, we focus on identifying excellent carers, making personalised matches, and building the tools needed to make ongoing care coordination simple.

The company is currently raising a new round of finance. As an existing shareholder, you have the right to exercise your pre-emption rights in order to maintain your current percentage ownership in the business. If you would like to exercise your pre-emption rights, simply click the invest button above and follow the instructions.

Please note that Preferred Shares are being offered to the lead investors as part of this round, and to Seedrs investors. The Preferred Shares have the right to a preferential return equal to 99.9% of the subscription price paid for such shares, on a realisation or return of capital. Ordinary shareholders will then be entitled to a return equivalent to the amount invested into the Ordinary shares, with any remaining proceeds being shared pro rata amongst all shareholders.
