## Idea

### Introduction

SkinnyBrands Ltd® was founded in October 2015 by northern entrepreneurs Tom Bell and Gary Conway. Their vision to create a range of ‘better–for–you’ alcohol alternatives without compromise, is now a reality.

The health-conscious consumer base is growing rapidly in all demographics, across all age ranges and between all genders. The consumer market is rapidly developing healthier alternatives from yoghurts, snacks, ready-meals and most recently soft drinks in response to the sugar tax. But the alcohol industry has dragged its heels, with no ‘better-for-you’ alternatives available – until now.

SkinnyBrands Ltd® is creating a new ‘Lifestyle’ category in the industry, and is driving a connection with consumers lifestyles through all marketing and communications. If you love great beer, want to cut calories, have a gluten intolerance or simply have an active and healthy lifestyle, we are the beer for you.

### Intended impact

Full Strength, Full Flavour &amp; Fewer Calories was the mantra they stuck to religiously in their pursuit of manufacturing perfection. Over 12 months, we developed a Lager that delivers all of this and more, Skinny Lager® was launched in late 2016. With such an incredible response, there was a phenomenal demand for additional products to continue the development of a new ‘lifestyle’ category. Cider was the perfect addition, complimenting the lager, and building the category further.

Skinny Lager® <br>• A full flavour Lager profile (produced by an established contracted brewer) <br>• 4% ABV <br>• 89 Calories 330ml (35% lower than the average) <br>• Carbs 0.9g per 100ml (72% lower than the average) <br>• Gluten Free <br>• Vegan Friendly <br>• Kosher

Skinny Cider® <br>• A full flavour Cider profile (produced by a world-renowned Cider maker) <br>• 5% ABV <br>• 149 Calories 500ml <br>• Carbs 0.5g per 100ml <br>• Sugar 0.5g per 100ml <br>• Gluten Free <br>• Vegan Friendly <br>• Kosher

### Substantial accomplishments to date

SkinnyBrands Ltd® over the last 2 years has seen outstanding growth in the industry, winning listings in 5 top major retailers in the UK, 20+ on-trade wholesalers including 5 national Routes to Market (RTMs), 1,000+ on-trade stockists and sales into 10 international markets. For a new brand with limited resources, the penetration Skinny Lager® has achieved in the market is testament to the brands quality and unique offering.

Launching most recently in the Australian market with one of the biggest and best liquor retailers in the world. Woolworths has launched SkinnyLager® across their liquor retail estate in Dan Murphy’s and BWS stores nationwide. The brand is competing in one of the most established low carb beer markets in the world, challenging with great quality, a much better taste profile and additional benefits over and above low carb.

The business has attracted industry talent. Recently hiring Adrian Hirst as UK and EU Sales Director. Adrian was previously the Global Sales Director for Kopparberg. He is spearheading the UK and EU growth in sales along with brand support and development for the introduction of Skinny Cider® into the market.

The business has raised £1,700,000 through a network of private investors, some of which have extensive experience in the alcohol industry and in building global brands.

SkinnyBrands® turned over £445k in 2016/2017* by the end of November we will have turned over £1.4m for the year, which is a 211% increase YOY.
