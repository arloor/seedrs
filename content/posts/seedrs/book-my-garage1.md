# [Book My Garage](https://www.seedrs.com/book-my-garage1)

## Idea

Book My Garage has recently closed 2 rounds of funding totalling £885,105 from the CEO, existing and new investors. This campaign is to allow investors to exercise their pre-emption rights and invest more, if they would like. As this is a pre-emption campaign open only for existing shareholders, minimum details are being provided. More information on Book My Garage is available in the downloadable document and the company’s website. Please note, this information has not been verified or approved by Seedrs.

The CEO currently has the benefit of preference shares in the company which entitle him to a total preferred return of £190,000, subject to EBITDA targets, commencing at £1m. The intention of this class of share is to finance the Company, with repayments being made only when the Company is deemed able to afford it.
