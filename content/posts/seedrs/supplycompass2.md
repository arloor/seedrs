### Introduction

Supplycompass is the SaaS enabled marketplace that helps brands build faster, leaner &amp; more responsible supply chains.

We are on a mission to create the world’s most trusted supply chains, to offer the most responsible and innovative sourcing solutions and to provide the most seamless experience for brands and manufacturers.

Supplycompass has had a very successful period of growth since the initial funding round in March 2018 and are now raising additional funding to support our growth.

As a current shareholder we are giving you early access to the round via an advanced subscription agreement which will be at a 20% discount to the price of the following round.

This is a pre-emption campaign, available only to existing investors, and therefore limited information is being provided about the company at this time.
