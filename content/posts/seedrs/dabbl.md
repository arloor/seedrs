## Idea

### Introduction

dabbl is like Shazam for investing. You take a picture of the product or brand that you love, then you can buy shares in the company that owns it.

dabbl is a design led product for mobile which caters for self-directed investors.  We have used the concept of company cards, that distill complex financial information into easy to read bite sized chunks. An intuitive search mechanism, enables users to search specific brands and/or categories to find companies to invest in. The app also enables users to track, save and review trends in the market or from other users to help inform their investment decisions.

Investments lead to full share ownership, with Shareholder benefits also available subject to availability. There is a fast and simple user on-boarding process with frictionless, digitised KYC and anti money laundering checks.

### Intended impact

Only 1.8% of the UK population used a self-directed investment account in the past 12 months.

In our view, people have become apathetic to financial services because they are boring, complex and expensive. dabbl plans to change that. We want to invigorate a new generation of investors, not just millennials but all those that don't invest.

We are reconnecting everyday people with the stock market. We are educating them that the entire world and brands around them are investable, and that is a great place to start their investment journey. We are helping those brands create affinity with their users and their shareholders by helping make them fans not just customers, which we feel increases their value.

We have created a beautiful app that is simple to use and sign up to. We offer a low cost membership model enabling people to invest from as little as they want.

Please note that any discounts, rewards and/or offers listed by a company in its campaign are subject to the terms and conditions applied by that company. It is the company’s responsibility to honour such discounts, rewards and/or offers and Seedrs does not take any responsibility for them.

### Notices

Share Classes - The company currently has 2 classes of shares, Ordinary Shares and B Ordinary Shares, which rank pari passu in all respects except that the Ordinary Shares carry additional board appointment rights. Investors in this round are being offered B Ordinary Shares.

Convertible - This round pricing calculates a fully diluted position including an assumed conversion of a £130k convertible note for 1.62% of total equity. This convertible accrues interest at a rate of 8% p.a, so may have a further dilutive effect on investors depending on timing of conversion.

## Market

### Target market

Our aim is to capture a new breed of self investors, with a particular focus on Millennials and Women.

There are 52 million adults in the UK, of which 1.2m are classed as self investors, essentially these are just consumers. Based on our own research, 34% of people (17.5m) have indicated they would like to start investing in shares.

Millennials are comfortable with digital technology, they grew up with it. We believe they are comfortable moving not only towards the web and away from brick-and-mortar businesses, but moving directly to mobile apps.

Almost two million investment-minded women want to invest, but are often put off by the underlying inequality that exists in this area.

Research has shown that such audiences feel they are alienated by jargon-filled marketing campaigns they assume are designed to appeal to wealthy men.

### Characteristics of target market

96% of UK Millennials do not have an investment portfolio, however over half (58%) would consider starting an investment portfolio. Indeed, nearly 75% of them say mobile banking is important.

Over 70% of Millennials said they would be more excited about a new offering in financial services.

Almost two million investment-minded women want to invest, but are often put off by the underlying inequality that exists in this area. A key finding from the recent report commissioned by EISA is that on average, women in the UK have in the region of £24,800 in investable assets and savings beyond that of property and pensions, translating to £375bn nationally.

Yet research has traditionally shown that women aren’t as likely to invest money as men. They are holding funds in cash (and sometimes property), but very few are investing in stocks and shares - despite women being responsible for owning over 45% of the UK’s wealth, only 14% of angel investors in the UK are women.

### Marketing strategy

We are building a consumer lifestyle brand that aims to fundamentally grow the self investor market. To do this we need raise awareness, educate and inspire millennials and in particular women, to discover investing opportunities around them and take action.

We will start with growth tactics designed to launch the dabbl brand and capture those already investing who are being impacted by high trading costs and complicated products. This will be supported with a digital programme and aided by PR outreach using key spokespeople, journalists and those already using our service.

Following this, we will use our raised capital to invest significantly into the brand awareness and investment education to grow the market. This includes above the line activity as well as more grass root student activation and community building tactics.

### Competition strategy

We aim to fundamentally disrupt the retail share dealing marketplace. Reducing the complexity and high barriers to entry for everyday people to take control and manage their investments themselves.

We see that people are increasingly looking to self advise and self invest as many in the U.S already do (Robinhood), as a result we have positioned dabbl distinctly from many of the other fintech startups, many of which are tailored for consumers who want a managed mobile app solution from investing to insurance e.g. Acorns (managed investment platform), Level Money (budgeting platform), Moven (debit card and personal money coach).

To our knowledge, we are more affordable than all existing stockbrokers and banks, allowing our users to start with small investments and grow. We feel that our user experience is much more intuitive and engaging akin to Uber and Shazam. We intend to grow the self investment market, significantly changing the behaviour of everyday people to take control and manage their investments.
