## Idea

### Introduction

Habu is an elegant, fresh and innovative room booking and space management platform. It’s software designed for coworking hubs, businesses centres &amp; venues with meeting or event spaces, who want to increase revenue whilst reducing time spent on admin.

Habu is all about reducing complexity inevitably faced by our target customers who have been using outdated, unconnected tools for too long.

Habu is easy to use, cloud-based software integrating the key elements for productive workflows with emphasis on contact, schedule and space management, ensuring that our customers always stay on top what’s going on across their buildings. The simple through to the ultra complex are handled with ease.

So whether it’s setting up automated internal meeting room booking systems or handling multi-staged event processes with large teams, Habu aims to enable smooth, productive workflows for the increasing number of coworking hubs &amp; business centres around the world.
