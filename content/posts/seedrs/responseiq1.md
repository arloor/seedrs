## Idea

### Introduction

PLEASE NOTE:

This is a pre-emption campaign following a recent raise of £484,818.75 offline. You have been notified about your minimum individual pre-emption rights but are welcome to invest more if you would like. Brief updates, metrics and plans are provided below:

• What we are: <br>A SaaS sales acceleration and conversion optimisation platform.

• What we do: <br>Convert website visitors and email leads to inbound sales calls using instant callback technology. We have customers such as Co-operative Travel, Trailfinders, UKinsuranceNET, Oxford Royale Academy, Buz.

• The Result: <br>Our customers can enjoy more sales calls, and the potential subsequent revenue, from their existing web traffic. We generate 3,000+ calls a day.

• The Opportunity: <br>Millions of businesses in the world have websites and are potentially leaving money on the table. We are here to help them. Our revenues have steadily increased, up to £64k in Dec 2018 (Based on unaudited management accounts).

### Substantial accomplishments to date

255 paying customers. <br>£64.5K in MRR. <br>Staff in London, Philippines and South Africa. <br>Developed our own SIP/Asterisks system to increase gross profit from 60% to 90%. <br>Built a sales machine which we believe is the envy of other companies.

### Monetisation strategy

Recurring monthly payments from our customers in exchange for packages, consisting of credits. <br>Customers range from £20/m up to £8k/m. <br>Average customer pays us £250/m. <br>Circa 50% demo complete to paying customer ratio.

### Use of proceeds

We will be investing in a South Africa sales office and a range of new products. <br>Our aim is for these products to open new markets and increase the revenue from our current customers significantly.
