## Idea

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/4447/jt5uyg5w9yrb31gdi4zxk2fd968zvuh/Branded_Header_Image_966__1_.png?rect=0%2C0%2C996%2C432&w=600&fit=clip&s=beabcbbda7a33190f705769cd3b9834e)

### Introduction

Trigger Buzz is a new creative technology business designed and built to disrupt the way marketing content and advertising is created and produced. Founded on the principles of creativity, speed, agility and effectiveness. We’re passionate about making new content, to new rules, across all new channels of communication, including Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and Instagram.

Our project platform, Trigger Hub, connects marketeers with a global, 600-strong, individually selected, creative community. Containing those at the cutting edge of digital creativity and production, we believe our ‘always-on’ community is more flexible and agile than traditional suppliers.

With a mobile app, planned for development in Q3 this year, Trigger Buzz aims to provide brands’ content needs anywhere in the world, on-demand. Making it faster, easier and more cost-effective than ever before for them to create the most shareable video and vines, tweets and visuals.

### Intended impact

The marketing world is witnessing the biggest revolution in how it supplies and sources content in the last 50 years. At Trigger Buzz we’re there to take advantage of that by transforming the way marketing content is bought, created, produced and managed.

Whilst the traditional model worked well for TV, print-centric ad campaigns and paid digital display advertising, we found it is neither fast enough, nimble enough or cost-effective enough to produce highly effective social engagement for brands in a social media world that is constantly evolving. As testament to the speed of change, in 2014 and 2015 alone there has been the launch of Meerkat, Periscope, Riff, PicLab, VidLab as well as the relaunch of Snapchat.

Instead of looking at traditional creative and production agencies for inspiration, we have based our model on the way real people engage with and use social media. Therefore our business architecture is based on building a large, global, external community of creative talent rather than a fixed internal creative resource.

Trigger Hub has the potential to change the way marketeers brief and manage their digital marketing, giving them greater value and ROI from their communication budgets. It is designed to provide a simple process that streamlines project management in a way that is more centralised, productive and efficient than ever before.

At the same time, we aim to offer new ways for brands to extend and integrate their existing campaigns and advertising assets across a variety of social channels. To this end, Trigger Buzz often works as part of a team of suppliers, helping both brands and their agencies alike. For creative talent, we are democratising the way they work by introducing them to brands across the world and empowering them to create highly creative content. We also enable them to work flexibly and with fewer barriers, whilst giving them the opportunity to exercise themselves entrepreneurially. We aim to create the virtual home for the best independent creative talents in the world.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

Generating real revenue from a range of top brands: <br>We’ve already attracted over £165,000* of revenue. This has come from repeat business with direct clients including; PUMA, Heart FM, Captial FM, Movember, Tabasco, MacMillan. At the same time, we have worked with brands through their existing agencies, including Florette, Petplan and the New York Bagel Company. With limited marketing activity, we have secured £85k* of revenues since 1st March 2015.

Recruitment of creative community: <br>We now have a database of around 1,500 registered users and over 600 approved community members.

Built and launched Trigger Hub: <br>We recently launched a Beta version of Trigger Hub to a select group of clients. A proprietary platform and tool, it’s been specifically built to enable clients and creatives to produce content simply and quickly.

### Monetisation strategy

One of the most attractive elements of our business model is the ability to create revenues from both our clients and our community. This will be achieved from three main activities;

When clients use the Trigger Hub platform <br>Clients will be charged a monthly subscription based on the number of users. These subscription costs are anticipated to be between £500 - £5,000 per month, per client.

We’re also planning to develop a ‘light’ app version of Trigger Hub in Q3 this year that will be specifically targeted at professional creative freelancers (such as those in our community). They will be able to use this for all of their content creation projects by paying a small monthly subscription.

When brands commission projects: <br>We will charge a commission, based on project value, to both the client and the talent when a project is completed. Clients will be charged 5% of the project cost, while the talent will be charged a 20% introduction fee. The average project value is currently almost £8k*.

When brands need our help to manage a project: <br>Clients who require support setting up and managing their projects can work with our specialist in-house teams. We will charge the team out at an hourly rate on a per project basis, based on the requirements of each project.

The revenue generating activities listed above will be packaged into three different products, each meeting the needs of different client profiles.

### Use of proceeds

The priority is to complete a full launch of the business to the UK market in 2015. Subsequently we believe Trigger Buzz has the potential to be a global game changer in the marketing industry. Therefore with these monies we also want to build the business assets so they can be scaled into new markets at speed.

Specifically we plan to fund:

1) Trigger Studio: the expansion of our creative community through marketing and partnerships. We will also create a test community in an international market.

2) Trigger Hub: Improve performance, appeal and usability based on initial client feedback. Improve accessibility through the development of apps for both the community and clients.

3) Sales &amp; marketing: Increase awareness and lead generation with our core audience groups including PR, event marketing and by increasing the size and use of our CRM database. <br> <br>4) Working capital: Create cash flow flexibility as we accelerate growth.

As a cash-flow back-up, we have in place a small loan arrangement. This facility has been offered by our existing board of directors and is capped at £25K. Should this facility be used (either partially or fully) during the campaign period, the monies may be paid back with interest (in line with market rates) from existing or future client project revenues and/or from the proceeds of this raise.

## Market

### Target market

We have three core audiences for our business;

Our service is most relevant for business-to-consumer (B2C) brands. A quick glance at a TV ad break will give you a feel for some of the biggest spenders and most well known brands, but there are more than 17,260 B2C brands in the UK fighting for consumer attention. These brands will invest in the marketing channels and activities that provide greatest access to their audience and the ability to create the greatest level of engagement. Our core audiences are the marketing decision makers and budget holders at brands that spend £250k per annum or more including; Marketing Directors and Managers, Brand Managers, Digital and Social Media Marketing Managers. These key people are looking to deliver maximum ROI from their marketing budget, which is where we believe we provide massive advantages over their current providers.

The second audience group are the estimated 560,000 agencies (PR, Media and digital) globally who support and deliver marketing for brands. Most of these agencies will be directly or indirectly supporting their clients’ digital marketing and content creation needs. There are three decision maker profiles we will target: production teams who are responsible for selecting production partners; account teams who manage specific brand clients; digital and social media teams who deliver digital specific projects.

<br>The third core audience group is the creative talent who form our community. We specifically target ‘independent creative talent’ who don’t fit the traditional model of what a creative should do, nor how or for whom they should work. These include anyone from vloggers and creative influencers with their own followings, to writers, designers, directors and videographers, who simply find the agency and production company environment too stifling and restrictive.

In summary, we are built for the next generation of brands, the next generation of marketeers and agencies, and the next generation of creatives.

### Characteristics of target market

The long term opportunity is to gain a share of brands’ global advertising spend which totalled $545bn in 2014. Focusing on our immediate target market, the UK, brands are expected to spend £16.2bn on advertising in 2015. Of which digital advertising is expected to account for £8.1bn, a 12% increase on 2014. Market data shows there are at least 3,348 B2C brands who spend £250,000 or more on advertising in the UK and 721 agencies who have 5 or more employees.

Marketing decision makers are currently dealing with a number of audience trends: <br>- Consumption of visual and video content is exploding; Facebook had 4 billion video views on a daily basis in Q1 this year. <br>- Mobile is becoming the device of choice to consume content; Roughly 75% of Facebook’s 4 billion video views were on mobile devices. Mobile ad spend is increasing year-on-year. <br>- The number of digital platforms is increasing; brands are now managing and creating content sources for an average of 7 social platforms.

### Marketing strategy

We have a comprehensive go to market strategy to fully launch the business in the UK. We will use a multi-channel approach to reach and drive our target audience from awareness to sale. To maximise efficiency we’ll break our audience down by type, size and marketing spend to prioritise resources and create tailored messaging.

Our focus will be a one-to-many sales strategy using industry events, PR coverage and industry body partnerships. Our Managing Director has already presented at a number of industry events and we plan to build on this in 2015. This will be supported with promoted content through email, social media and digital marketing. Providing an opportunity to target specific job roles, websites and web searches with personalised messages.

These one-to-many tactics will feed our CRM strategy, which already contains a database of more than 4,139 contacts. We will regularly share company news, case studies and thought leadership through email newsletters and social media marketing. Our CRM strategy will be supported with telemarketing focused on warm prospects who have engaged with a piece of content.

Larger, high priority prospects will receive a tailored approach managed by the senior sales team. We will place greater resource in thought leadership and bespoke solutions to solve their specific content challenges.

Recruiting new community members will solely focus on a one-to-many marketing strategy. Based on activity to date we have an accurate understanding of conversion and the CPA. We plan to optimise and scale this strategy during 2015 to include forming partnerships with entities who can provide access to large numbers of creative talent e.g. Universities, industry bodies and complimentary service providers.

### Competition strategy

The way in which people consume content has changed beyond recognition. The way it's commissioned, created and produced hasn’t. Until now.

Apparently a business that can do something faster, cheaper and better is a myth - they say you can only ever successfully deliver two of these benefits at any one time. But we feel we’re demonstrating to brands that they can develop better content, faster and cheaper with Trigger Buzz. As we’ve already mentioned ‘better’ content is content that’s more relevant, topical and timely. This means speed is critical and doing this on a scale to make an impact in digital marketing requires a cost effective solution. We believe the ability to deliver ‘better, faster, cheaper’ is our core competitive advantage, and we do this through the combination of Trigger Studio, Trigger Hub and our team's ability to help brands enhance their strategy.

Specifically our competitive advantage will be created through;

- Developing the size of our community and breadth of creative skill sets to offer a more comprehensive on-demand service than other providers. <br>- Increasing the quality of our community through improved testing to ensure we have the best group of creatives available. <br>- Creating exclusive partnerships with institutions that house creative talent, particularly industry bodies and top university courses, to facilitate a knowledge exchange and access to the best talent of the future. <br>- Increasing community members’ loyalty by helping develop their skills and knowledge through support, tuition, activities and events from aspirational category experts.

- A platform that’s built for the sole purpose of creating content in a more streamlined and efficient way. <br>- Launching an app to provide a more accessible service to both brands and creatives. <br>- Plug-in complimentary service providers, allowing clients to complete more elements of the digital marketing process through our platform.
