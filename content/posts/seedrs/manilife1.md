## Idea

### Introduction

We are a craft peanut butter brand... <br>Who source the finest ingredients from farmers we know and love... <br>However, it is our unique approach to roasting and blending that makes <br>ManíLife...

...the best tasting peanut butter in the world.

### Intended impact

ManíLife brings craft culture to peanut butter, a booming market.

Where growing incumbents talk about adding nothing; celebrating 'natural nuttiness' and 'fitting more nuts in', we talk about doing more; masterfully roasting and blending the best peanuts from a single farm to create mind blowing products (we add nothing too...).

ManíLife was created out of a chance meeting with the people behind our partner farm in Argentina. I fell in love with them (and their peanuts) and came home in 2015. We imported a ton of their crop, but the day it arrived our manufacturing partner pulled out. That summer two blenders, 45 friends and a rugby kitchen came together - ManíLife was born.

Our products delight and our story inspires. It's as much about the community as it is about the peanut butter.

Many things drive ManíLife but paying back the countless people who've volunteered along the way tops the list.

Many people volunteered to help make ManiLife what it is today - even Stu's Gran.

## Market

### Characteristics of target market

• Appreciation of value over price <br>• Foodies - generally cook for themselves <br>• ABC1 peanut butter consumer who will trade up <br>• Health conscious but taste focused <br>• Range of ages - we speak to 21-35 year olds but are purchased by people as old as 80

### Marketing strategy

From our experience at events and tasting sessions: <br>• People who taste ManíLife tend to buy it. <br>• Non peanut butter consumers who taste ManíLife Deep Roast are often converted to peanut butter. <br>• People who hear ManíLife's story are inspired by it and tend to buy in.

Our marketing strategy therefore revolves around: <br>• Driving mouths per hour.

We will do this via: <br>• Proliferation of ManíLife minis - recipe boxes, cafes, hotels, retail locations outside of the spreads aisle etc.

• Branded food service - marketing ManíLife as an ingredient to cafe and bakery chains. <br>• In and out of store samplings

• Spreading ManíLife's story

We will do this via: <br>• Driving PR <br>• Social Media Engagement <br>• Community Engagement <br>• Events <br>• Public speaking occasions

### Competition strategy

There are 3 major players in Peanut Butter - Whole Earth, Sunpat and Meridian.

We split the market into 3 categories.

Naughty but nice: <br>• Sunpat is stagnant

Add nothing do nothing: <br>• Pip &amp; Nut 71% YoY growth <br>• Meridian 35.2% YoY growth <br>• Whole Earth 16.1% YoY growth

Craft brands:. <br>• ManíLife 250% YoY Growth*

As the market undergoes further 'premiumisation' we believe the number of consumers entering our end of the market to increase naturally.

We will help drive this through expanding distribution and sampling.

ManíLife will maintain its competitiveness through continuing to innovate on formats and peanut products with the aim of maintaining our position as the tastiest peanut butter in the UK.
