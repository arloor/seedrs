## Idea

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/1289/kzc8aaxj1irfa72fh37e8qm91oywbno/CW_Logo.PNG?rect=68%2C20%2C872%2C112&w=600&fit=clip&s=9e6b69855dd15b3e7a2088846b354183)

### Introduction

Charlie &amp; Wolf (C&amp;W) is an independent digital publisher for children’s entertainment, developing children’s books into interactive apps, eBooks and websites. The first book series C&amp;W plans to release is titled ‘George &amp; the Ice Cream Castle’ (GICC).

C&amp;W plans to develop the GICC series into an interactive app that contains three books, two games and three cooking video tutorials. The books will also be available to purchase as eBooks through major online retailers.

Via the website of GICC parents would be encouraged to join the C&amp;W parent portal, providing them with healthy lunchbox ideas, recipes, activities, downloads, competitions and advice from renowned health coach Madeleine Shaw.

Revenue is anticipated to be generated through in-app purchases on the Apple iStore and sales of the eBooks, based on a 'freemium' model.

C&amp;W has a long-term vision of maximising the commercial value of its most successful publications through the extension of merchandising, televised animation and physical books.

### Intended impact

Charlie &amp; Wolf’s vision is to educate, entertain and inform through a fun, interactive and current learning experience, so that both children and parents can be guided and made aware of the value of eating healthily and consciously.

We hope to raise awareness of the importance of food as a ‘fun fuel’ and provide stories, games and activities through multiple book series, which encourage alternatives to the current kids ‘lunchbox’.

In the UK the prevalence of children aged 2 – 10 years that are classified as overweight including obese is 28. 2% (Health Survey for England, 2010). C&amp;W hope to make an impact on reducing this percentage by encouraging children and parents to be more involved in understanding what they are eating and where it comes from.

C&amp;W understands that there is a social and commercial move in society towards adopting a health conscious lifestyle, making our vision even more accessible.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

• The author (Jessica Shepherd) has assigned the full intellectual property rights (IPR) of the ‘George &amp; the Ice Cream Castle’ (GICC) series, as well as options for further series with C&amp;W.

• C&amp;W has an agreed contract for the GICC series (between one to five books) with illustrator and animator, Byrony James. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="outside" href="http://bryonyjames.blogspot.co.uk/">http://bryonyjames.blogspot.co.uk/</a>

• C&amp;W has an agreement with Madeleine Shaw, a certified health coach who will be providing C&amp;W with recipes to be used within the books and apps, videos of her demonstrating the recipes, advice for parents via the ‘parent portal’, lunch-box ideas and relevant seasonal recipes/health tips.

• An experienced CTO/project manager from BSGSport Ltd has been appointed as a contractor to ensure the delivery of the technology meets timing and requirement deadlines.

### Monetisation strategy

REVENUE: The business initially has two main revenue streams.

1. In-app purchases within the GICC mobile application

2. eBook sales of books 2 &amp; 3 of the GICC series.

The business estimates that 15% of the total downloads will convert to a sale of an IAP.

We estimate 20% of total downloads of book1 will convert to a sale in book2. Following a 50% drop off of customers purchasing book3.

PRICE: There are 4 planned purchase options in the mobile app IAPs that have a range from £2.49 - £6.99. Average price based on 50% drop off after first purchase and accounts for 50% of first purchase being ‘access all’ at £6.99. This accounts for an Apple iStore 30% fee on IAP.

eBooks available for purchase include:

1. Free to download access to Story 1

2. £3.49 per story thereafter Accounting for a 12.5% fee for e-pub.

DISTRIBUTION:

C&amp;W will utilise the Apple App market, leveraging its global distribution to maximise its total audience capacity. eBooks will be distributed through e-pub, which will publish the story globally on a number of localised stores.

MARKETING:

C&amp;W will leverage social media marketing, public relations and relationship marketing to gain exposure across the digital channels to maximise downloads.

### Use of proceeds

80% of monies raised will go towards the development and building of the technology infrastructure that will contain the digital publications and games, as well as the illustration/animation and trademarking of the initial book series GICC.

20% raised will be used as working capital for the business in the first 12 months including marketing, public relations and administration costs.

## Market

### Target market

Charlie &amp; Wolf has 2 main target markets:

1. The Parents: C&amp;W as a brand will target active parents with children aged 2-10 years, promoting its values, ethos and knowledge to parents offering a wider set of services on top of the applications through the 'parent portal'.

2. Children &amp; Parents: C&amp;W will target its apps and eBooks at children aged 2-10 years and their parents, encouraging them to engage with the brand through the multiple platforms and activities.

• Primary launch market is the UK and secondary is USA/Australia.

• C&amp;W is targeting health conscious parents or parents who want their children to be more interested in what they are eating, through reading, games and learning.

• C&amp;W will initially be targeting families/parents who own Apple mobile devices in order to access the mobile app through Apple iStore.

• C&amp;W will also aim our marketing efforts towards families/parents who have purchased reading tablets and eBooks for their children, as well as those who are looking to make the switch from hard copy to electronic.

### Characteristics of target market

C&amp;W conducted an online survey in March 2014 with 104 parents from the UK, U.S. and Australia; a combined total of 228 children. Some of the findings concluded that:

• 92% of parents would like their children to be more involved in what they are eating and where it comes from. <br>• 90% of parents would be interested in an app that educated children about healthy eating.

Disney UK surveyed 2,000 UK parents who own an app-enabled device, finding that ‘more than 1/3 of parents now see apps as integral to family life’.

2 in 5 parents spend up to £10 each month on apps, meaning UK families could be spending an estimated £132 million a year. According to a study by PlayCollective/Digital Book World, 67% of U.S. children aged 2-13 are now reading eBooks, 85% of those children e-read at least once a week.

The average monthly sales figure for children/young adults’ eBooks in 2011 was 3.9 million; in 2012 that monthly figure had increased to 22.6 million. (AAP, 2012).

C&amp;W will have a strong social presence and create constant engagement across all social media platforms, strategically following key industry and influential people/parents. <br>It will use social media to communicate with its consumers and inform of interesting articles, photos and updates. <br> <br>BRAND AMBASSADORS:

C&amp;W aims to enlist influential parents within its key markets to become brand ambassadors, sharing the C&amp;W philosophy of healthy eating and education with their friends, family, following and parent/learning groups.

PARTNERSHIPS:

C&amp;W is looking to form partnerships with a number of children’s event companies and selected healthy food/drink brands.

COMPETITIONS:

C&amp;W plans to create online competitions specifically targeted around school holidays, which engage with its current users and encourage new users/followers. The prizes for the competitions will allow the children to become involved with the next C&amp;W story, as well as personalised GICC merchandise.

### Competition strategy

The main point of difference for C&amp;W is via what it aims to achieve through its books and apps, healthy kids with an interest in their lifestyles and cooking. C&amp;W is not just providing an app/eBook we are providing parents and children with educational tools that take them through their childhood development.

• By releasing a minimum of 3 stories and 2 games within 1 app we aim to provide the users with more value than most storybook/game apps currently on the market.

• The technology platform we are building allows us to add new stories and games to the app as an update, so instead of having to drive our current users to download a new app, we create an update and notify them via the app that a new story/game is available for purchase.

• The platform and structure we build will be able to be re-used as a framework for future apps/ebooks, reducing the cost of development significantly.

• We have a talented team and are looking to collaborate with a number of individuals/companies/authors/illustrators going forward to produce the best possible stories and game experiences.

• C&amp;W is providing its users with a 'freemium' pricing experience, so that they are able to read and play with the first book completely free. This is in the belief that 15% of users who download the app will go on to make an in-app purchase to access the games world or books 2/3. Pricing will remain competitive and be evaluated regularly, as well as providing promotional incentives for users.

• Regular evaluation of our apps/books through surveys, Q&amp;A’s on the parent portal, analysing social media data and online tools such as ReviewForDev’s and Promoter.

• C&amp;W isn’t just motivated by profit; we want to make a positive difference to how people enjoy their lives.
