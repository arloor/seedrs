## Idea

### Introduction

As this is a pre-emption round open only to existing investors, limited information is being provided at this time.

Following the great progress we’ve seen in the last quarter, we are now raising £122k from existing investors to extend working capital until next year. This will give us additional time and resources to further improve and strengthen our economics prior to raising a planned larger round in Q2 2019.

Our current sale pipeline is looking particularly strong. Brands that have recently signed up and committed to long term packages following successful trials include; Marriott Hotels, The Ivy Collection, Bill’s Restaurants, Caprice Holdings, Ricker Restaurants and many more. We are continuing to successfully grow revenue numbers with over 50% QoQ growth for the most recent quarter (source: unaudited management accounts).
