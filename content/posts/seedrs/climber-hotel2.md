## Idea

### Introduction

In April 2016, we completed a successful crowdfunding campaign on Seedrs of £80,640.

In February 2018 we fund-raised a private round of €350,000.

This campaign is a pre-emption campaign based on this amount. It is only open to existing investors, so limited information is being provided at this time.

What is Climber? <br>Climber is a Revenue Management Software for hotels. We tell small hotel chains and independent hotels what is the optimal price they should sell their rooms.

Why are we valuable? Because we aim to help hotels increase revenues and make the life of the Hotel Manager easier.

How are we different? Unlike existing Revenue Management companies (RMS), to the best of our knowledge, we are the only company focusing on small hotel chains. We aim to be easier, faster and more affordable.

Please note that the lead investors in this round have received preference shares, with a 1x non-participating preference in the event of a sale, winding up or distribution of capital.
