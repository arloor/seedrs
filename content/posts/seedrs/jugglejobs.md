## Idea

### Introduction

Via an easy online experience, Juggle.Jobs places high-quality professionals on a flexible basis, into lead and management roles.

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/11456/o229e2lxph29go42u6jw2oxw6o9s49x/Untitled.png?rect=0%2C0%2C975%2C680&w=600&fit=clip&s=acbfcce2e07ec2aa19011f02ed94e6ce)

Every professional is vetted before becoming a member. Members receive personalised services such as access to executive coaching and tailored interview training; as well as access to relevant, high-quality jobs.

They receive timely updates on their application and the terms of their placement are negotiated to suit their needs. The support doesn’t end there! Once in work, Juggle ensures each professional has the tools and support they need to be successful.

Each business is also vetted to join the platform. Customers then experience a high-quality level of service where shortlists are curated for specific needs and businesses are efficiently guided through the recruitment process to on-board the best professional.

By charging a monthly fee rather than a lump sum, customers know we're truly committed to finding the right match.

### Intended impact

Our hyper connected and driven world can lead to professionals feeling they have to choose between rewarding home lives OR great careers. "Having it all" has been coined as a myth of the past and unachievable.

Businesses also suffer from the status quo as women are sorely under-represented in leadership roles, employee engagement is waning, and burnout is on the rise.

We are solving this problem by giving professionals the option to have both a great career and flexibility for a fulfilled home life. This also gives businesses the benefit of access to a higher quality and more diverse talent pool.

Via an easy online experience, Juggle.Jobs connects high-quality professionals to businesses on a flexible basis, for lead and management role. We negotiate the working terms and help both parties to make the arrangement really work.

We are on a mission to ensure 50% of our business leaders are women and believe tapping into this highly motivated workforce is the way to do it.

### Monetisation strategy

The service is free for professionals.

Businesses pay on results only and via a monthly charge model.

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/11464/rh29s1phdvqeem84k46lolgby69r07/Untitled10.png?rect=0%2C0%2C975%2C265&w=600&fit=clip&s=a21b249c4abaae68f893c00dfaaf4711)

For contract arrangements we charge 15% of the timesheets which are calculated via submitted timesheets to the platform.

For permanent employees we also charge a monthly fee and this fee is agreed once a job is registered and business vetting completed. Charges range from £500p/m for Financial Controllers, through to £1500p/m for Chief Financial Officers. These are examples of packages available for businesses of below 250 people which is our initial target market.**

Once a professional is offered, a business will be asked to pay a month deposit and set up a direct debit. The contract length for a permanent employee arrangement is 12 months and if a professional leaves before this point, JJ does not charge beyond their end date.

### Use of proceeds

0-4 months. <br>- Hire the core team of eight: product leader, two senior software engineers, UX/UI designer, customer acquisition lead, client services lead and two engagement manager's . <br>- Build basic functionality for business customers, professional members and begin gathering data for the algorithm. <br>- Test our message to market via online channels, marketing the service to SME business customers and potential professional members.

4-8 months. <br>- Hire additional Account Management support and a mobile developer. <br>- Build the data algorithm allowing businesses to make informed decisions on their hiring by testing "culture" factors. <br>- Use PR to access a wider range of business and professional customers.

8-12 months. <br>- Improve core features within the platform so professionals can be placed within 7 days (currently 15) and the experience is fantastic. <br>- Increase marketing spend to enable "growth".

## Market

### Target market

The last 3 months of user testing has given us clear findings for our go-to-market strategy. Below is some information on our initial target market:

We are solving an immediate problem for SME business customers by giving access to and placing high-quality professionals into CFO (chief financial officer), FD (finance director) and FC (financial controller) roles. Many existing services are largely offline and service levels are poor so we are able to get traction by simplifying simple tasks and being customer oriented. Many traditional recruitment agencies are incentivised to place but not manage the ongoing relationship.

![](/img/seedrs/uploads/startup/section_image/image/11466/l7eev3p5z7su0b2wfjuubxldxpjmkqr/Untitled11.png?rect=0%2C0%2C975%2C302&w=600&fit=clip&s=5a1115686417b78922f60d8c064088db)

On the professionals side, we have attracted very high-quality, educated and motivated professionals in the "finance" function. The majority of placements to date have been women and this will be our dominant customer base on the professionals side of the marketplace. We believe that female professionals at this level are currently underpresented and no talent service exists to service their needs in this way.

We're tapping into an underutilised talent pool of professionals. By supporting these individuals, we're unlocking their potential and providing businesses with a highly motivated, inexpensive talent solution in exchange of some flexibility.

We intend to scale to other key job functions this year: HR/Talent and Law in particular after building a reputation and loyalty with SME business customers. Learning from these placements and a critical mass of JuggleJobs placements will mean we can then start targeting corporate customer.

Professional Services are our target enterprise business customer. Many have been under increasing pressure to cut fixed overheads such as full-time permanent staff and fixed office space. The flexible working platform and marketplace will allow corporates to transform their businesses and augment their business demand in a different kind of way.

### Characteristics of target market

Our Professional Members are Qualified Accountants, highly educated and very experienced. They have the need or desire to work more flexibly but have the ambition to continue developing their careers.

Our SME business customers have less than 250 people. They have a need for high-quality, experienced manager's and leads but do not have the budget to pay London and corporate prices for these individuals. Fluctuations in business demand mean they often need project or part-time workers rather than fixed permanent overheads. We are working with the business owner or MD/C level making the hiring decisions. Consequently they will have awareness of the wider benefit Juggle can offer such as a lean towards diverse professionals and ongoing support to manage the flexible working arrangement.

Our corporate business customers are London based Professional Services firms currently planning for business efficiencies. Cutting fixed overheads such as permanent FTE's and London office space are high on the agenda. All have regulatory pressures such as the Lord Davis Report (mandating 25% representation of women on Boards and perhaps soon to be exec level too); and Gender Pay Reporting. Regulatory pressures such as these highlight the need for quick action on diversity hiring. Our sponsorship is via a Managing Partner and the ongoing relationship with the Head of HR/Head of Diversity.

### Marketing strategy

Our Content Marketing exploring two central themes. These two themes will be solution led and come under different headings, across multiple content pieces, across multiple channels. This narrow focus but wide distribution will enable us to test how messaging is being received and which channels are the most effective. Once multiple strategies have been tested, we will allocate more spend to that channel and theme. Applicable to acquire Professional Members &amp; SME Businesses Customers.

Referral Mechanism: Our objective is to on-board and place more high-quality professionals using organic referral mechanisms and therefore multiple offers will be tested to evaluated which resonates with the market and why. Once multiple strategies have been tested, we will allocate more spend to that channel and theme. Applicable to acquire Professional members &amp; SME Business Customers.

Job Advertising. /// We will allocated majority spend to this channel where our CPA (cost per acquisition) is very low. Applicable to acquire Professional Members.

Offline Marketing. A small budget will be allocated to tailored thought-leadership events enabling us to establish relationships with potential corporate customers. We will continue to spend small amounts of capital at a steady rate for this activity. Applicable to acquire Professional Members and Corporate Customers.

PR. A small amount of time will be spent from now to build relationships with the key journalists exploring the central themes tested through our Content Marketing strategy. This aim to culminate in press attention on interesting topics, led by the Founder in Q3/Q4 of 2017. Applicable to acquire Professional Members, SME Business Customers and Corporate Customers.

### Competition strategy

A number of businesses are coming into this space. However we believe ours is best placed to disrupt the traditional recruitment market because we combine the easy of an online experience to access the professionals, with the quality of a human experience where people are accurately matched and well managed. Marketplace meets SAAS.

Details on competitors with similar themes but different business models:

Traditional Recruitment Agencies focusing on diverse professionals: <br>- Sapphire Partners. <br>- Capability Jane.

Tech Enabled Recruitment Agencies focusing on diverse professionals: <br>- Obelisk.

Job-Boards focusing on part-time / flexible / diverse jobs: <br>- Timewise.

Talent Marketplaces focusing on flexible/diverse jobs without curated shortlists: <br>- Power-to-fly. <br>- Werk. <br>- Lifeshifter.

Talent Marketplaces with saas/management components - not "white collar": <br>- Upwork.
