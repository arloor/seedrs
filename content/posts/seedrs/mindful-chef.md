## Idea

### Introduction

Mindful Chef (mindfulchef.com) is a 1 year old recipe box company.

We focus on the healthy and premium end of the recipe box market and ship all the ingredients that you need to make 2-5 evening meals - all with fresh organic produce and no refined carbs (no pasta, no white rice, no bread).

We pride ourselves on our innovative uses of vegetables in evening meals that are both gluten-free and dairy-free. We ship nationwide, and cater for 1 person, 2 person and 4 person boxes. To our knowledge we also offer the UK's first and only vegan recipe box, alongside our meat and fish options.

### Intended impact

It takes time to plan for healthy meals, it is hard to source fresh products and there is often a lot of wastage. We solve that by delivering all the good-for-you ingredients that you need to create a delicious healthy evening meal for your family together with a recipe card. This saves our customers hours of time and importantly allows them to stick to a healthy routine.

We very much see our service as a "start of the week" product. As such, we deliver across the country on a Monday and on a Sunday evening within London. This allows our customers to enjoy healthy evening meals at the start of the week, before the distractions of a busy life take them elsewhere later in the week.

We like to think of a Mindful Chef delivery as the healthy heart of our customers' week and as our retention statistics demonstrate, we quickly become part of our customers' lifestyle. After a few weeks of eating our meals, customers report feeling an improvement in their health, and this boosts our retention enormously.

We have designed a product that the health and fitness industry can endorse - national gym chains, boutique fitness studios and a network of health and wellness professionals help us reach our (largely female) target market.

### Substantial accomplishments to date

We raised our first external money in December of last year and have since accelerated to a weekly revenue run rate of over £20,000*.

We have now sold over 75k recipes to thousands of happy customers across the UK.

We are the UK's #1 recipe box company as voted by our customers on Trustpilot (9.5/10) and we would encourage you to read the reviews.

We have recently been nominated for Startup of the Year by the High Potential Business Awards, the only company in our category to be nominated within their first year of trading.

### Monetisation strategy

Each week we ship all the ingredients that our customers need to make 2, 3, 4 or 5 evening meals. We ship 1, 2 and 4 person boxes catering for single diners as well as families. After ingredients, packaging, labor and delivery we currently achieve about a 25% gross margin* (dependent on box type).

We make money by retaining customers for many weeks after we have been paid back for our Customer acquisition cost (CAC). Our average Payback Period is around 5.8 weeks, whereas our average active customer has made over 10 purchases (a number that is increasing as we get older). We take 60% of customers through to week 3, and a third of all customers are making a purchase in Month 6 after joining our service.

### Use of proceeds

► Marketing, Tech and Team:

We plan to spend approximately £600k on marketing in the next 12 months. This will be aided by the addition of a Digital Marketing Associate to our team, along with an in-house Videographer. We will spend an additional £150k on technology, improving UX further and investing in a mobile app.

## Market

### Target market

Our best customers are:

- 30-40 year old ABC1 females <br>- Settled/coupled (buying 2 person boxes) <br>- With a set weekly routine meaning they will almost certainly be cooking at home at the start of the week (this routine is often driven by young children) <br>- Interested in health and wellness <br>- Understand what healthy food looks like and the benefits of eating well <br>- Intention to exercise 2+ times a week.

This customer cohort displays the fastest Payback periods and the largest LTVs.

Our wider customer base includes:

- Young busy City workers <br>- Retirees (with a new found care for health) <br>- Women who want their family to enjoy healthy evening meals.

### Characteristics of target market

£9bn is spent online on groceries in the UK each year, forecast to be £18bn by 2020. It is the fastest growing sector of e-commerce.

In the US, research firms like Technomic have pointed towards recipe boxes making up $3-5bn of the $1.2tn grocery and restaurant market. If that holds in the UK, recipe boxes would be 0.25% of the £178bn grocery market. Of that £445m spend on recipe boxes, we believe we could hold a significant share of the premium end of the market.

Free-from / Healthy / Organic is the fastest growing part of the grocery market within the fastest growing part of e-commerce. Online sales of organic products grew +9.1% (Total organic sales £1.95bn). Sales of Free-From products grew even faster (+13% y/y) to £531m.

Spending on gym memberships soared +44% in 2015 and we believe that boosts spending on relevant products like ours.

### Marketing strategy

Our strategy is to drive an audience to a highly targeted piece of content that “pre-qualifies” them for remarketing. We will add to this with video content post fundraise. The bulk of our traffic is Organic/Direct and as a result we are very committed to investing in great content, investing in long tail search, and allowing customers to continue to find us.

The Mindful Chef brand allows us to talk to potential customers on lots of different levels - recipes, nutrition, provenance, Mindfulness, health and fitness. After customers have engaged with the brand a few times, they are ready for targeting with highly focused adverts.

We have built a product that can be endorsed by the health and wellness industry and already leverage partnerships with some of the country's largest gym groups. This is low activation, but a highly targeted audience which potentially turn into great customers.

Referral is a strong channel for us already and we are now building technology to supercharge it.

### Competition strategy

We are the healthy, premium product within the category and as such we focus our marketing efforts on SEO/direct, select partnerships (we have built a product that the Health &amp; Fitness industry will endorse) and content marketing.

All this allows us to pre-qualify audiences as being interested in healthy food, before we present the Buy Now button. We will have a lower Total Addressable Market than the mass market companies in our category, but given the sheer size of the grocery market (and the huge growth in the organic/free-from/health end of that market that we sit in) we think we are very well positioned to win the hearts and minds of our customers and create an aspirational brand.

We believe the superior quality of our product is demonstrated in what we would describe as industry-leading retention data.
