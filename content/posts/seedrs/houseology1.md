## Idea

### Introduction

The award-winning Houseology.com website is the UK's leading online interior design store, disrupting the way customers design and shop for their homes online â€“ and the way designer brands reach a unique target audience.

The company has proposed a new issue of 38,573 ordinary shares in the capital of the company to raise additional cash for the operation of the Company, at a decreased valuation.

Further details can be found in the 'Shareholder Letter' document attached.
