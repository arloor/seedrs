## Idea

### Introduction

We are going out to our shareholders to raise funds to follow an updated path for growth. Details of the strategy can be found in the pitch document attached.

We are raising up to a maximum of £1m and we have so far raised £716,859 from existing shareholders. Your pre-emption rights are based on this amount however you are able to apply for more than your rights.

Please note that the information in the attached document hasn't been reviewed or approved by Seedrs.

As this is a pre-emption campaign open only to existing investors, limited information is being provided at this time.
