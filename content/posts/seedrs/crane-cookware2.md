## Idea

### Introduction

Crane is a British design and manufacturing company, specialising in professional cookware and accessories, filling a position in the market for affordable, well-designed everyday cooking tools that use the highest quality materials and manufacturing methods available, which stand out for their refined detailing &amp; made in Europe credentials.

We believe focussing on use and longevity; staying clear of over-styling or gimmick novelties that are often found in this market. Functional and utilitarian design - whilst at the same time resolutely modern, characterful, generous and a pleasure to cook with.

We are now working to introduce a range of 18/10 stainless steel pans our 'S' range designed by Felix de Pass, as well as a range of accessories in 2016, aimed at a wider market at a more competitive price point. We have re-invested revenue from our first year of trading in order to develop the designs of this new range.

"I love Crane's products. They marry design and function perfectly and have become favourite items both in my kitchen and on the table." - Ed Smith - writer for Rocket &amp; Squash.

"I think this range would be a great addition to our core range for SS17. Great design and price point." - Sophia Gomm The Homewares buyer at Conran.

### Intended impact

We have received some incredible feedback on our pans from leading chefs;

"I saw these about a year ago and have since acquired a set. They look artisanal in a practical sort of way and the cast iron black look stands them apart from all the other pots and pans on my shelves. I also love the fact that they work on my V Zug induction Hob as no other cast iron pan I’ve owned in the past does. These boys don’t rust like other cast iron pans if you don’t dry them properly so maintenance free. They also double up as saucepans and casseroles and, of course, the look alone allows them to be serving pots straight from the oven" <br>Mark Hix.

Our collection of products and brand is non gender specific and we hope to see a non prescribed approach to the way people cook and entertain when using our products. This has been reflected in our sales.

We have understood our niche with the majority of our retail sales achieved through independent lifestyle/design shops which do not stock competitor products.

### Monetisation strategy

We have understood from our first year of trading that our customers are looking for a wider range of products to compliment our first range. We are therefore developing new products to meet this demand. The 'S Range' stainless pans will increase our market share significantly as they are less specialist than the cast iron range. Please contact us for detailed forecasts.

We generate revenue in the following ways;

1) Wholesale of our pans working directly with retailers such as La Fromagerie, The Conran Group, The Stores, Daylesford Organic. Working in Taiwan and China with distribution and working to distribute our products across, Canada, USA, Japan and Australia with Esse. <br> <br>2) We look to attend trade shows including Ambiente, Maison et Objet.

3) Introduction of our range of 18/10 stainless steel pans by British designer Felix de Pass. Crane 3-ply stainless steel pans are made using a progressive, triple-layer system.

4) We are planning for the introduction of a range of accessories including, cutting and serving boards, pepper mill and a cooks aprons will help us optimise spend through our online shop.

Boards - A series of serving and chopping boards made using 5-axis CNC technology from solid FSC timber.

Pepper Mill - Characterised by an innovative easy-fill feature, offering superior function without spillage and using the Crush-Grind ceramic grinder mechanism. Made in the EU.

Apron - A cooks apron made by traditional workwear specialists Dolmen founded in France in 1922.

Through the introduction of a more everyday series of stainless steel pans and useful accessories, we believe we are able to further reach the market we have already established for our first 4 products. We have already shown in our first year of sales that there is demand for premium quality, well designed core tools of the kitchen.

### Use of proceeds

Funds raised plans to be used on the following areas:

1) Tooling &amp; stock of the stainless steel range and accessories.

2) Working on direct selling through advertising, DM and further collaborations including trade shows.

3) Packaging and brand material for the new ranges.

## Market

### Target market

► Size and Growth rate of our target market

The Global Houseware and Speciality market has a total revenue of $53.6 billion dollars in 2013 of which cookware was its most lucrative reflecting 38.9% of total market value. The performance of the market is forecast to accelerate, with an anticipated CAGR of 6.8% of the period up to 2018 reaching $75.46 billion dollars.

► Target Customers

Our main customers are professional men and women, who are focussed on good quality kitchenware and take pride in their kitchen and cooking. Research by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi identifies this group as the major demographic who purchase Le Creuset products, one of the main competitors in this market.

We believe the Asian consumer can be a promising future market for Crane Cookware, as we have just sold our first container load of cast iron pans into China. We anticipate that one in four luxury goods customers are Chinese. China has bypassed Japan as the second largest market for luxury goods after the USA. We believe Asian consumers are looking for unique and convenient housewares and high quality imports with distinguished design and heritage credentials.

3) Working with Esse distribution in Canada, Australia, USA and Japan.

4) Online.

5) Partnerships with Publishers and Media Partners offering competition giveaways and exclusive recipes from food writers/chefs so far this has included, Bloomsbury, Phaidon, Emerald Street and Country Living in October 2016.

6) Newsletters &amp; Social Media - We have a mailing list of 5,000 + subscribers and 1,500 social media followers since launching in July 2015.

### Competition strategy

Through the quality of the product, its design branding and price point. We believe we offer superb design and production credentials against our competitors but at a 15% lower price point.

These ingredients we feel certain based upon our first year of sales, will continue to create disruption against our leading competitors.

We will continue to develop high quality products made from enduring materials with leading designers using sustainable European manufacturing. We will continue to develop pared-back products that focus on meaningful innovation, use and longevity; staying clear of over-styling or gimmick novelties that are often found in this market.
