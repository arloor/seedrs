## Idea

### Introduction

As the CTO of an e-commerce agency for 10+ years, our founder witnessed the problems with innovating and scaling bespoke e-commerce websites, before retailers moved to powerful platforms like Magento and Demandware.

In today's mobile first world, we believe that many retailers are having similar growing pains with bespoke native apps. Poq was created to provide a commerce platform for native apps – allowing retailers to innovate on mobile in a scalable way.

Poq is a commerce platform for native retail apps. The SaaS platform enables over retailers, including House of Fraser, Missguided, Steven Alan, Radley and Blue Inc, to deliver best-in-class mobile apps across Android and iOS – updated quarterly and integrated with any major e-commerce platform. We offer large retailers a reliable and scalable way to deploy and maintain native apps.

Our team of experienced professionals is mostly focussed on technology development and have a wide e-commerce background.
