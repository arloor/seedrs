## Idea

### Introduction

Having won Techcrunch's Europa awards Best Advertising / Marketing startup in 2016 Adludio is planning for hyper growth.

Adludio has built a technology that facilitates the ability for advertisers, to create and then distribute, innovative advertising that taps into the functionality of mobile devices. Its proprietary technology includes a web based interface for the building of the ad units, a new language to ensure the ads are lightweight and render correctly on any device, and an AI algorithm that will manipulate a creative in realtime against an advertisers pre defined KPI's.

As this is a pre-emption round made available only to existing shareholders, limited information is being provided about the company.

### Intended impact

Mobile handheld devices have become the first screen for most consumers, and yet the creative that is delivered onto these screens has until now tended to be 30 second made for TV commercials or 1990's banners. Using it's propreitary technology, Adludio is solving the problem of how to deliver excellent creative, quickly and at scale on any screen. It is disrupting the existing advertising creative process, and delivering non intrusive, highly engaging advertising that can be delivered through programmatic advertising channels

### Share Class

The Company is offering Series A Shares to the two institutional investors participating in this round. On a winding up, exit, sale, liquidation, Series A Shareholders have a 1x preference over ordinary shareholders or, if higher, may instead participate pro rata alongside ordinary shareholders.

Seedrs investors will be offered Ordinary Shares so that their investment can qualify for EIS relief (which preference shares would not be eligible for). Tax relief always depends on individual circumstances and is subject to change.
